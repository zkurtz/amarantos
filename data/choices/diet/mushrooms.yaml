domain: diet
name: Mushrooms (18g+/day)
summary: |
  Contain ergothioneine (unique antioxidant) and beta-glucans. Meta-analysis of
  cohorts (n=602K): 6% lower all-cause mortality with consumption. 34% lower
  cancer risk in meta-analysis of 17 studies. Benefits for breast cancer most
  consistent. Ergothioneine associated with 14% lower CVD mortality. Evidence
  quality moderate for mortality; cancer evidence has limitations.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of prospective cohorts (n=601,893): mushroom consumption
      associated with RR 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98) for all-cause mortality.
      (https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-021-00738-w).
      NHANES: HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.95) for mushroom consumers.
      Ergothioneine metabolite associated with HR 0.86 for mortality.
      Associative evidence.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.04
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Ergothioneine may protect against oxidative stress and age-related
      decline. Associated with healthy dietary patterns. No epigenetic clock
      studies. Speculative.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No direct mood RCTs. Part of healthy dietary patterns. Some medicinal
      mushrooms (different from culinary) have adaptogenic properties.
      Indirect evidence only.
    mean: 0.1
