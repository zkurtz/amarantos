  description: "Recommended: 2-3g/day. Amino acid derivative important for fatty acid
    metabolism. Meta-analysis of\nRCTs shows 27% reduction in all-cause mortality
    in secondary prevention (post-MI\npatients). Reduces ventricular arrhythmias by
    65% and angina by 40%. Concerns\nabout TMAO production via gut microbiota. Benefits
    primarily in cardiac patients,\nnot general population."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    DiNicolantonio 2013 meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (n=3,629) in secondary
    prevention: 27% reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99).
    65% reduction in ventricular arrhythmias. 40% reduction in angina.
    (https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(13)00127-4/fulltext).
    Causal evidence from RCTs but in cardiac patients only. Mendelian randomization
    suggests possible CAD risk in general population. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9434903/).
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No human aging studies. Supports mitochondrial function in theory.
    Animal studies suggest some benefit. TMAO concerns may offset benefits.
    Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May reduce fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome and improve exercise
    capacity. Limited RCT data in healthy individuals. Small positive effect
    possible in those with deficiency.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Amino acid derivative important for fatty acid metabolism. Meta-analysis
  of\nRCTs shows 27% reduction in all-cause mortality in secondary prevention (post-MI\n\
  patients)."
