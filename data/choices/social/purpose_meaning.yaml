domain: social
name: Sense of Purpose (ikigai, meaningful work/activities)
summary: |
  Having a sense of purpose, meaning, or reason for living (ikigai in Japanese).
  Prospective studies: strong purpose associated with 20% lower mortality.
  Japanese cohort (n=43,000): lacking ikigai associated with higher CVD
  mortality. Mechanisms may include better health behaviors, stress resilience,
  and social engagement. Evidence quality moderate; associative.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 10 prospective studies (n=136,265): high purpose in
      life HR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.91) for all-cause mortality.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26630073/). Japanese cohort
      (n=43,391): lacking ikigai associated with higher CVD and external
      cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18596247/).
      Consistent associative evidence.
    mean: 0.83
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Purpose associated with reduced inflammation, better metabolic health,
      and possibly slower cognitive decline. May promote health behaviors.
      No direct epigenetic aging studies. Moderate indirect evidence.
    mean: 0.8
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Eudaimonic wellbeing (meaning/purpose) associated with life satisfaction
      independent of hedonic pleasure. Retirement without purpose associated
      with decline. Finding meaning buffers against stress. Moderate-large
      positive effect.
    mean: 0.7
    std: 0.3
