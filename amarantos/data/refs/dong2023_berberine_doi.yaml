summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 studies (n=3,048) examining berberine for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Berberine significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (WMD -0.82 mmol/L), HbA1c (-0.63%), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (-1.16 mmol/L). Glucose-lowering effects stronger in patients with prediabetes/diabetes. Treatment considered safe with no increased risk of hypoglycemia or serious adverse events.'
