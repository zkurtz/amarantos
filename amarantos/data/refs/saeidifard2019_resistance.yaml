summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies (370,256 participants, 8.85 years average follow-up) examining resistance training and mortality. Resistance training alone associated with 21% lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Combined with aerobic exercise showed 40% reduction (HR 0.60). Borderline association with reduced cardiovascular mortality."
