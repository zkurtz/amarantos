summary: Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (135,967 participants) examining vitamin E supplementation
  and mortality. Found dose-response relationship with high-dosage supplementation
  (400 IU/day or more for at least 1 year) potentially increasing all-cause mortality
  in adults with chronic diseases. Lower dose effects were unclear.
