summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 RCTs (176,253 participants) examining
  omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes. Found significant
  reductions in cardiovascular mortality (6%), CHD events (10%), and MI (11%), but
  no significant effect on all-cause mortality. EPA monotherapy showed stronger effects
  than combined EPA/DHA.
