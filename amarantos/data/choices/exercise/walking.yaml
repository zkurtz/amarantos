  description: "Recommended: 8,000-10,000 steps/day. Most accessible exercise. 2022
    Lancet meta-analysis (15 cohorts): 10,000 steps\nassociated with ~50% lower mortality
    vs <4,000 steps. 2023 meta-analysis: each\n1,000-step increase = 15% lower mortality.
    Optimal at ~8,700 steps for mortality\nreduction. 7,000 steps/day achieves most
    benefit with diminishing returns above.\nNo equipment needed. Evidence quality
    very high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Paluch 2022 meta-analysis (15 cohorts): ~50% lower mortality at 10,000
    vs <4,000 steps. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289978/).
    2023 meta-analysis (n=226,889): each 1,000-step increase = 15% lower
    all-cause mortality, 500 steps = 7% lower CVD mortality. Optimal at
    8,763 steps (HR 0.40). (https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.07.029).
    Associative evidence; highly consistent.
  mean: 0.55
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Regular walking prevents functional decline and sarcopenia. Associated
    with slower cognitive decline in older adults. Low-impact preserves
    joint health. Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Walking associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety in meta-
    analyses. Nature walks particularly beneficial. Social walking groups
    enhance effect. Accessible for all fitness levels. Moderate positive
    effect.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Most accessible exercise. 2022 Lancet meta-analysis (15 cohorts): 10,000
  steps\nassociated with ~50% lower mortality vs <4,000 steps."
