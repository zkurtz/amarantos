summary: Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs involving 127,477 participants examining marine
  omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease. Found significant reductions
  in total CVD (RR 0.97) and total CHD (RR 0.95). Dose-response analysis showed linear
  relationships between omega-3 dose and cardiovascular benefits.
