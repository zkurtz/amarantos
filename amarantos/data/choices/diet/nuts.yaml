  description: "Recommended: 28g/day. Among the most evidence-backed foods for CVD
    and mortality. Meta-analysis of\n20 cohorts: 22% lower all-cause mortality, 27%
    lower CVD mortality, 30% lower\nCHD mortality per 28g/day. PREDIMED RCT: 28% lower
    major CVD events, 47%\nlower CVD mortality with walnuts. Rich in unsaturated fats,
    fiber, polyphenols.\nEvidence quality high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Dose-response meta-analysis: per 28g/day nuts: RR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.84)
    for all-cause mortality, RR 0.71 for CHD.
    (https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-016-0730-3).
    PREDIMED: 39% lower CVD mortality with walnuts >3x/week.
    (https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2017.09.035). Causal and
    associative evidence; highly consistent.
  mean: 0.80
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Associated with healthy aging and reduced frailty risk. Rich in
    antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. No epigenetic clock
    studies. Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Part of healthy dietary patterns associated with better mood. Walnuts
    contain omega-3s. Limited direct mood RCT data. Small positive effect
    plausible.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Among the most evidence-backed foods for CVD and mortality. Meta-analysis
  of\n20 cohorts: 22% lower all-cause mortality, 27% lower CVD mortality, 30% lower\n\
  CHD mortality per 28g/day."
