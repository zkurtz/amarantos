summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 53 studies examining metformin''s
  effects on aging-related outcomes independent of glucose control. Found diabetics
  on metformin had lower all-cause mortality than non-diabetics (HR=0.93), and substantially
  better survival compared to other diabetes treatments (vs non-metformin: HR=0.72,
  vs insulin: HR=0.68, vs sulphonylureas: HR=0.80). Also showed reduced cancer incidence
  and cardiovascular disease risk.'
