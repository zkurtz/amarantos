summary: Prospective cohort study using NHANES 2003-2014 data from 23,894 US adults.
  Found that higher dietary spermidine intake was associated with 30% lower all-cause
  mortality (HR 0.70) and 32% lower CVD mortality (HR 0.68) comparing highest to lowest
  quartiles. Benefits observed across multiple food sources including vegetables,
  cereals, legumes, nuts, and cheese.
