  notes: "Meta-analysis of 10 studies. Maximum benefit at ~60 minutes/week (27% reduction, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64-0.86). Benefits diminished at higher volumes. Also found 19% lower CVD mortality and 14% lower cancer mortality."

summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 studies examining resistance training and mortality. Any resistance training associated with 15% lower all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.93), 19% lower cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-1.00), and 14% lower cancer mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.95). Dose-response analysis showed maximum benefit at ~60 minutes per week (27% reduction) with diminishing returns at higher volumes."
