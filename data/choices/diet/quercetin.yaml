  description: "Recommended: 500-1000mg/day. Flavonoid with antioxidant and potential
    senolytic effects. Meta-analyses show\nmodest BP reduction (-3mmHg SBP in hypertensives),
    reduced LDL and fasting\nglucose. Senolytic effects (with dasatinib) promising
    in preclinical models;\nhuman trials ongoing. Single-agent senolytic effects uncertain.
    No mortality\nRCTs. Evidence quality low-moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis: SBP reduction -3.19mmHg in hypertensives,
    reduced LDL and total cholesterol.
    (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/jaha.115.002713). Umbrella review:
    uncertain effects on most cardiometabolic factors.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37654199/). Theoretical CVD benefit via
    BP/lipid effects; extrapolated estimate.
  mean: 0.97
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Senolytic when combined with dasatinib (D+Q). May clear senescent cells
    and reduce SASP. Q-CABG trial examining effects in cardiac patients.
    (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.741542/full).
    Single-agent effects uncertain. Moderate uncertainty.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. May reduce inflammation which affects mood. Part of
    healthy dietary patterns. Indirect evidence only.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
summary: "Flavonoid with antioxidant and potential senolytic effects. Meta-analyses
  show\nmodest BP reduction (-3mmHg SBP in hypertensives), reduced LDL and fasting\n\
  glucose."
