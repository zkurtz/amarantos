domain: exercise
name: Swimming (2+ times/week)
summary: |
  Full-body cardio with minimal joint impact. UK cohort (n=80K): 28% lower all-
  cause mortality, 41% lower CVD mortality vs non-swimmers. Compared to sedentary,
  swimming HR 0.66 for all-cause, 0.48 for CVD mortality in older adults. Suitable
  for all ages, joint conditions, and rehabilitation. Improves lipid profile and
  BP. Evidence quality moderate-high.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      UK cohort (n=80,306): swimming HR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.80) for all-cause
      mortality, HR 0.59 (95% CI: 0.46-0.75) for CVD mortality.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27895075/). Swimmers had 53% lower
      all-cause mortality vs sedentary, 49% lower vs runners.
      (https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/ijare/vol2/iss3/3/). Associative evidence.
    mean: 0.72
    std: 0.05
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Cardiorespiratory fitness strongly linked to biological aging. Low
      joint impact preserves mobility into older age. May improve flexibility.
      Strong biological plausibility.
    mean: 1.5
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Swimming associated with improved mental health and stress reduction.
      Water-based exercise particularly beneficial for chronic pain. Social
      component at pools. Moderate positive effect likely.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
