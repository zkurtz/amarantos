domain: diet
name: Curcumin/Turmeric (500-2000mg/day)
summary: |
  Polyphenol with potent anti-inflammatory effects. Meta-analysis of 103 RCTs
  shows significant effects on 55% of outcomes tested. Reduces CRP, IL-6, TNF-α.
  Improves lipid profile and glycemic markers. No mortality RCTs. Bioavailability
  enhanced with piperine or lipid formulations. Evidence quality moderate;
  surrogate markers improved but hard endpoints lacking.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. 2024 comprehensive meta-analysis of 103 RCTs (n=7,216)
      shows significant effects on FBS, CRP, HDL, and weight with high credibility.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39478418/). Reduces inflammatory markers
      and improves ASCVD risk factors. Theoretical CVD benefit. Extrapolated
      estimate.
    mean: 0.95
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Reduces markers of inflammaging (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). May protect against
      cognitive decline via anti-inflammatory effects. Animal studies suggest
      lifespan benefits. No human epigenetic clock data. Speculative.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analyses show benefits for depression and cognitive function in
      some populations. May reduce joint pain in arthritis. Anti-inflammatory
      effects may improve overall wellbeing. Small positive effect plausible.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
