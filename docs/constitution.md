# Constitution

## Mission

Amarantos ranks lifestyle interventions by their expected impact on healthy lifespan, making the tradeoffs between cost, time, and benefit explicit and comparable.

## Vision

A personal decision-support tool that evolves with its user—adapting recommendations to individual circumstances, age, and constraints while maintaining rigorous uncertainty quantification.

## Strategy

- **Evidence-first**: Every effect estimate traces back to cited research with explicit confidence intervals
- **Conservative defaults**: Rankings use 30th percentile estimates, favoring interventions with tighter evidence
- **Transparent uncertainty**: No hidden assumptions; when data is weak, the wide confidence interval says so
- **Practical framing**: Costs in dollars, time in hours/year—units that map to real decisions
- **Incremental growth**: Add interventions and refine estimates as better evidence emerges
