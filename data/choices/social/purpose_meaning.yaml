  description: "Recommended: ikigai, meaningful work/activities. Having a sense of
    purpose, meaning, or reason for living (ikigai in Japanese).\nProspective studies:
    strong purpose associated with 20% lower mortality.\nJapanese cohort (n=43,000):
    lacking ikigai associated with higher CVD\nmortality. Mechanisms may include better
    health behaviors, stress resilience,\nand social engagement. Evidence quality
    moderate; associative."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 10 prospective studies (n=136,265): high purpose in
    life HR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.91) for all-cause mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26630073/). Japanese cohort
    (n=43,391): lacking ikigai associated with higher CVD and external
    cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18596247/).
    Consistent associative evidence.
  mean: 0.83
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Purpose associated with reduced inflammation, better metabolic health,
    and possibly slower cognitive decline. May promote health behaviors.
    No direct epigenetic aging studies. Moderate indirect evidence.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Eudaimonic wellbeing (meaning/purpose) associated with life satisfaction
    independent of hedonic pleasure. Retirement without purpose associated
    with decline. Finding meaning buffers against stress. Moderate-large
    positive effect.
  mean: 0.7
  std: 0.3
summary: 'Having a sense of purpose, meaning, or reason for living (ikigai in Japanese).
  Prospective studies: strong purpose associated with 20% lower mortality.'
