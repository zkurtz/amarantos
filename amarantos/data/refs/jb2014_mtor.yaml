  - outcome: influenza vaccine response
    mean: 1.2

  notes: RAD001 reduced PD-1+ T cells, suggesting improved immune signaling; acceptable
    tolerability at tested doses

summary: Randomized controlled trial examining mTOR inhibitor RAD001 effects on immune
  function in elderly adults. Found RAD001 enhanced influenza vaccine response by
  approximately 20% and reduced percentage of PD-1+ CD4 and CD8 T cells. Results suggest
  mTOR inhibition may have beneficial effects on immunosenescence in the elderly.
