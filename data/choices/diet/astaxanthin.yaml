domain: diet
name: Astaxanthin (4-12mg/day)
summary: |
  Potent carotenoid antioxidant from algae/seafood. Modest benefits for lipid
  profile (LDL reduction) and blood pressure. No mortality trials. Promising
  pilot data in heart failure (improved ejection fraction). Better safety
  profile than vitamin E. Evidence is preliminary; mostly small trials.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 17 studies (n=1101) shows improved
      lipid profile. Fassett 2017 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27924978/).
      Theoretical CVD benefit via lipids/inflammation but unproven for hard
      endpoints. Unlike vitamin E, no signal of harm. Centered at null.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.1
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Strong antioxidant in vitro. Animal studies show benefits. Human aging
      studies absent. Reduces oxidative stress markers. No epigenetic clock
      data. Speculative.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Pilot heart failure study showed improved exercise tolerance (+39m on
      6MWT) and quality of life. Xia 2020
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292897/). Limited to HF
      patients. No general population mood data.
