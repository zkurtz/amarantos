summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials with 1,721 participants examining hydrolyzed collagen effects on skin aging. Found significant improvements in skin hydration (SMD 0.63, p<0.00001) and skin elasticity (SMD 0.72, p<0.00001). Long-term supplementation (>8 weeks) and fish-derived collagen showed superior results for hydration outcomes."
