  notes: 10 studies included; 530,515 events; also showed 31% reduction in cardiovascular
    mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.71); in CVD survivors, dog ownership showed
    RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.17-0.69); analyses not adjusted for all confounders

summary: Meta-analysis of 10 observational studies (n=3,837,005 participants, 530,515
  events, mean follow-up 10.1 years) examining dog ownership and mortality. Dog ownership
  associated with 24% reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.86)
  and 31% reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.69). In prior CVD patients,
  dog ownership showed even stronger protection (RR 0.35). Results possibly driven
  by cardiovascular mortality reduction.
