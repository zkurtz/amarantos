summary: Meta-analysis of 95 prospective cohort studies examining fruit and vegetable
  intake and disease risk. Found dose-response relationships with reductions in cardiovascular
  disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality up to 800g/day intake. Leafy greens and
  cruciferous vegetables showed particularly strong protective associations. Estimates
  suggest 5.6-7.8 million premature deaths globally may be attributable to insufficient
  intake.
