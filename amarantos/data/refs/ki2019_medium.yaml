summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 publications (7 RCTs) involving 422 participants examining medium chain triglycerides in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. MCTs successfully elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (MD 0.355, 95% CI 0.286-0.424). Combined cognitive outcomes (ADAS-Cog + MMSE) showed significant improvement (SMD -0.289, 95% CI -0.551 to -0.027), though ADAS-Cog alone did not reach significance. Authors note need for higher-quality future trials."
