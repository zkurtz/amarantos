summary: 'Prospective cohort study of 469 community-dwelling adults over age 75 with median 5.1-year follow-up. Found cognitive leisure activities (reading, board games, musical instruments, dancing) associated with reduced dementia risk (HR 0.93 per 1-point increment). Physical activity alone showed no significant protective effect. 124 dementia cases observed.'
