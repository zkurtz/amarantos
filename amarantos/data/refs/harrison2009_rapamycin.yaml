summary: Landmark study demonstrating that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, extends
  lifespan in mice even when treatment begins late in life (600 days). Female mice
  showed 14% lifespan extension and males showed 9% extension. Study was replicated
  across three independent test sites using genetically heterogeneous mice.
