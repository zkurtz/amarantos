  description: "Recommended: 500-3000mg/day. Medicinal mushroom (Hericium erinaceus)
    that stimulates NGF and BDNF synthesis.\nRCTs show cognitive improvement in MCI
    (MMSE +1.17 points); benefits decline\nafter discontinuation. Mixed results in
    healthy adults; some null findings.\nNo mortality data. Safe with minor GI side
    effects. Evidence quality low-moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality data. Systematic review shows neuroprotective effects and
    cognitive improvement in MCI patients. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12434001/).
    No cardiovascular outcomes studied. Speculative estimate based on
    cognitive preservation hypothesis.
  mean: 0.98
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Stimulates NGF and BDNF, supporting neuronal health. RCT in MCI: improved
    MMSE scores with 16-week supplementation. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413233/).
    May protect against cognitive decline. Benefits reversible upon stopping.
    Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Pilot studies suggest reduced subjective stress and improved mood in
    some populations. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10675414/).
    Mixed results overall. Small positive effect possible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.4
summary: "Medicinal mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) that stimulates NGF and BDNF synthesis.
  RCTs show cognitive improvement in MCI (MMSE +1.17 points); benefits decline\nafter
  discontinuation."
