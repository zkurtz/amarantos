  description: "Recommended: 5-15g/day. Hydrolyzed collagen improves skin elasticity,
    joint health, and bone density\nin RCTs. Meta-analyses show modest LDL reduction
    (-4mg/dL) and BP reduction\n(-5mmHg). May increase fat-free mass. No mortality
    studies. Benefits most\nevident after 3+ months. Evidence quality moderate for
    joints/skin."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of RCTs shows reduced LDL (-4mg/dL) and
    SBP (-5mmHg). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35658958/). Theoretical
    CVD benefit via lipid/BP improvements. Extrapolated estimate with high
    uncertainty.
  mean: 0.98
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Improves skin hydration and elasticity in RCTs.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10180699/). Supports joint and
    bone health. No epigenetic clock studies. May slow visible aging markers.
    Speculative for biological aging.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May reduce joint pain and improve mobility in osteoarthritis. Improved
    skin appearance may enhance self-perception. Limited direct mood data.
    Small positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Hydrolyzed collagen improves skin elasticity, joint health, and bone density\n\
  in RCTs. Meta-analyses show modest LDL reduction (-4mg/dL) and BP reduction\n(-5mmHg)."
