domain: pharmaceutical
name: Hormone Replacement Therapy (menopause/andropause)
summary: |
  Estrogen/progesterone for menopause or testosterone for low-T. WHI trial
  complicated: timing matters (younger initiation safer). May improve quality
  of life and bone health. Testosterone may improve body composition and
  vitality. CAUTION: cancer, CVD risks depend on timing, formulation, and
  individual factors. Evidence quality moderate-high but complex.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      WHI reanalysis: HRT initiated <10 years post-menopause HR 0.70 for
      mortality; >20 years post-menopause HR 1.17.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17341714/). KEEPS and ELITE trials
      support timing hypothesis. Testosterone: TRAVERSE trial showed CVD
      safety but no mortality data. Complex; individual risk assessment needed.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.12
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Hormones decline with age; replacement may slow some aging processes.
      Estrogen: bone protection, possible cognitive benefits. Testosterone:
      muscle, bone, body composition. Timing-dependent effects. Moderate
      uncertainty; depends on individual factors.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      HRT dramatically improves menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, sleep,
      mood). Testosterone improves energy, libido, mood in low-T men.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26914628/). Significant QoL
      improvement for symptomatic individuals. Moderate-large positive effect.
    mean: 0.6
    std: 0.4
