domain: exercise
name: NEAT (standing, fidgeting, daily movement)
summary: |
  Non-exercise activity thermogenesis: energy from daily activities excluding
  formal exercise. Standing increases expenditure 10-20% above sitting; walking
  100-200%. NEAT ranges from 15% to 50% of total daily expenditure. Sedentary
  behavior independently associated with CVD mortality even with exercise.
  Standing/walking improves insulin sensitivity better than equivalent cycling.
  Evidence quality moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Canadian cohort: dose-response between sitting time and all-cause/CVD
      mortality independent of exercise. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6058072/).
      Standing/walking of longer duration improves insulin action and lipids
      more than equivalent-energy cycling.

      Reducing sedentary time associated with reduced metabolic syndrome, CVD
      events, and mortality. Associative evidence.
    mean: 0.82
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Prolonged sitting associated with accelerated biological aging. Breaking
      up sitting time improves metabolic markers. May support joint mobility
      and reduce sarcopenia risk. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Standing desks associated with improved energy and reduced back pain.
      Regular movement breaks improve alertness. Small positive effect plausible.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
