  description: "Recommended: 3-5 day water fast, periodic. Extended fasting periods
    of 3-5 days, typically water-only, done periodically\n(1-4x/year). Profoundly
    activates autophagy and stem cell regeneration in\nanimal models. Fasting-mimicking
    diet (FMD) RCTs show improved biomarkers.\nCAUTION: medical supervision recommended.
    Limited human longevity data.\nEvidence quality low; mostly mechanistic and FMD
    surrogate data."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs for prolonged fasting. FMD trial (n=100): improved
    CVD risk factors, reduced IGF-1, lower inflammation markers.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28202779/). CAUTION: risks include
    electrolyte imbalance, refeeding syndrome if not done properly.
    Speculative mortality benefit with notable risks.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.15
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Strongest autophagy activation of fasting interventions. Animal studies:
    periodic prolonged fasting extends lifespan. FMD reduces biological
    age markers in humans. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148523/).
    Promising but limited human data. High uncertainty.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 1.0
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Fasting period: significant hunger, fatigue, cognitive fog (days 1-2).
    Many report mental clarity days 3-5 (ketosis). Post-fast: improved
    relationship with food, appreciation for eating. Net effect variable.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
summary: "Extended fasting periods of 3-5 days, typically water-only, done periodically\n\
  (1-4x/year). Profoundly activates autophagy and stem cell regeneration in\nanimal
  models."
