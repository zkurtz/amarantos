summary: Prospective cohort study using KORA F4 (Germany) and Normative Aging Study
  (USA) examining associations between long-term air pollution exposure (PM10, PM2.5,
  black carbon, NOx) and biological aging measures (telomere length and epigenetic
  markers). PM2.5 exposure of 0.97 ug/m3 correlated with 0.33-year increase in extrinsic
  epigenetic aging. Associations appeared sex-specific with black carbon/NOx affecting
  DNA methylation aging in women.
