  choice: taurine
  evidence_type: Mechanistic/first-principles
  effect_size: null
  effect_ci_lower: null
  effect_ci_upper: null
  outcome: "lifespan and healthspan extension"
  population: "mice, monkeys, worms; human observational data"
  sample_size: null
  followup_years: null
  notes: "Taurine levels decline with age across species. Supplementation reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. Lower taurine correlated with age-related diseases in humans. Exercise increased taurine levels."

summary: "Mechanistic study demonstrating that circulating taurine levels decline with age across mice, primates, and humans. Taurine supplementation reversed this decline and extended both lifespan and healthspan in mice by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against telomerase deficiency, suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing DNA damage, and attenuating inflammaging. Lower taurine correlated with age-related diseases in humans; exercise increased taurine concentrations."
