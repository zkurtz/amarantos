summary: "Narrative review examining how intermittent fasting (IF: 12-48 hour fasts repeated every 1-7 days) and periodic fasting (PF: 2-7 day fasts monthly or less) affect longevity and disease prevention. Reviews evidence from yeast to humans, identifying conserved nutrient-sensing signaling pathways that regulate cellular aging. Discusses therapeutic potential for cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular conditions. Both fasting and refeeding periods contribute distinct benefits."
