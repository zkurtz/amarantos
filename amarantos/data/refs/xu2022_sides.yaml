summary: Meta-analysis using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 179 traditional fermented
  food samples from various geographical regions. Examined both potential benefits
  (probiotic properties, beneficial microorganisms) and risks (opportunistic pathogens,
  antibiotic resistance genes) of traditional fermented foods classified by fermentation
  raw materials, substrates, and climatic zones.
