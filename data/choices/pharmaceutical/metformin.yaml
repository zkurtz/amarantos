  description: "Recommended: off-label longevity use. First-line diabetes medication
    studied for longevity. UK observational:\ndiabetics on metformin had lower mortality
    than non-diabetic controls.\nTAME trial ongoing for primary prevention. Activates
    AMPK, mimics caloric\nrestriction. May blunt exercise benefits. CAUTION: prescription
    drug with\nGI side effects. Evidence quality low for non-diabetics; extrapolated."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    UK CPRD study: diabetics on metformin had 15% lower mortality than
    matched non-diabetic controls. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25041462/).
    Meta-analysis in diabetics: reduced all-cause mortality vs other
    treatments. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28881964/). TAME trial
    for non-diabetics ongoing. Extrapolated; uncertain in healthy adults.
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.12
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Activates AMPK, reduces IGF-1, mimics caloric restriction pathways.
    C. elegans and mouse studies show lifespan extension. Human biomarker
    studies show improved aging markers. CAUTION: may blunt exercise
    adaptations. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30548390/). Promising
    mechanistic basis; human aging data limited.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    GI side effects common (nausea, diarrhea) especially initially.
    Extended-release better tolerated. B12 deficiency with long-term use.
    No expected positive wellbeing effects. Small negative effect due
    to side effects.
  mean: -0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "First-line diabetes medication studied for longevity. UK observational:\n\
  diabetics on metformin had lower mortality than non-diabetic controls."
