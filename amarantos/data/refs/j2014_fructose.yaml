summary: 'Randomized controlled trial of 355 overweight/obese adults aged 20-60 examining
  fructose-containing sugars at various consumption levels (8-30% of calories). Over
  10 weeks, found no significant effects on blood pressure. Modest changes in lipids
  observed: triglycerides increased (104 to 114 mg/dL), HDL decreased slightly (53
  to 52 mg/dL). Total cholesterol and LDL unchanged.'
