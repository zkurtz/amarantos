  description: "Recommended: >7g/day. Cornerstone of Mediterranean diet. Meta-analysis
    of 13 cohorts: 15% lower CVD\nrisk, 17% lower all-cause mortality for highest
    intake. PREDIMED RCT: 31%\nlower CVD, 48% lower CVD mortality with EVOO. Each
    10g/day reduces CVD risk\nby 10%. Benefits plateau around 20g/day. Rich in polyphenols
    and oleic acid.\nEvidence quality high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2022 meta-analysis of 13 cohorts: RR 0.85 for CVD, RR 0.83 for all-cause
    mortality with higher consumption.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9623257/). PREDIMED: HR 0.52
    for CVD mortality with highest tertile consumption.

    Causal (RCT) and associative evidence.
  mean: 0.85
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Mediterranean diet (olive oil-rich) associated with slower biological
    aging. Polyphenols have anti-inflammatory effects. Associated with
    healthy aging patterns. No epigenetic clock studies specific to olive
    oil. Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Mediterranean diet associated with better mood and cognitive function.
    May reduce inflammation linked to depression. Indirect evidence only.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Cornerstone of Mediterranean diet. Meta-analysis of 13 cohorts: 15% lower
  CVD\nrisk, 17% lower all-cause mortality for highest intake."
