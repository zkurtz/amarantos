- summary: Genetically predicted higher L-carnitine associated with increased coronary
    artery disease risk
  choice: l_carnitine

  effects:
  - outcome: coronary artery disease (odds ratio per SD)

  notes: Effect stronger in men (OR 1.09) than women (OR 1.00); also associated with
    higher triglycerides and lower HDL

summary: Mendelian randomization study examining genetically predicted L-carnitine
  levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Found higher L-carnitine associated with
  increased coronary artery disease (OR 1.07) and heart failure (OR 1.05) risk, particularly
  in men. Also associated with adverse lipid profile (higher triglycerides, lower
  HDL). Results do not support beneficial cardiovascular effects of L-carnitine.
