  notes: Analysis of two clinical trials (NCT02158897, NCT04150159). Also showed reduced
    insulin resistance, lower hepatic fat, improved glucose in pre-diabetics, and
    younger immune profile (increased lymphoid-to-myeloid ratio). Exploratory secondary
    analysis.

summary: Randomized controlled trial analyzing blood samples from two clinical trials
  examining fasting-mimicking diet effects. Three FMD cycles in 52 participants (vs
  16 controls) associated with reduced insulin resistance, lower hepatic fat, improved
  glucose levels in pre-diabetics, and a median 2.5-year reduction in biological age
  independent of weight loss. Increased lymphoid-to-myeloid ratio indicated younger
  immune system status.
