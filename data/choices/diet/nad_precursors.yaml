  description: "Recommended: NMN/NR, 250-1000mg/day. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)
    and nicotinamide riboside (NR) boost NAD+\nlevels reliably. Meta-analyses show
    elevated blood NAD+ but limited functional\nbenefits in RCTs. No improvement in
    muscle mass/sarcopenia in older adults.\nSome cognitive trials show reduced epigenetic
    age but no cognitive improvement.\nEvidence quality low; promising preclinical
    data not yet translated to humans."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (n=513): NMN raises NAD+ but
    most clinical outcomes NS vs control. Risk of bias concerns in most
    studies. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39116016/). Meta-analysis:
    NMN/NR show minimal benefits for sarcopenia.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12022230/). Highly speculative
    estimate.
  mean: 0.98
  std: 0.12
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    NR trial in MCI: reduced epigenetic age (PhenoAge, GrimAge) but no
    cognitive improvement. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10828186/).
    Benefits may be limited to those with suboptimal baseline NAD+. Promising
    but unproven in humans. High uncertainty.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 1.2
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Select improvements in gait speed and grip strength in some trials.
    Energy benefits reported anecdotally. Limited RCT evidence. Small
    positive effect possible.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.4
summary: "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR) boost NAD+\n\
  levels reliably. Meta-analyses show elevated blood NAD+ but limited functional\n\
  benefits in RCTs."
