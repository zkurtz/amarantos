  description: "Recommended: 3-5g/day. Simplest amino acid, involved in collagen synthesis
    and glutathione production.\nExtended lifespan in mice. Lower levels associated
    with diabetes, CVD in\nobservational studies. Mendelian randomization shows modest
    evidence for reduced\nBP and T2DM risk, but NOT CAD. GlyNAC combination shows
    promise in elderly.\nNo mortality RCTs. Evidence mixed."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Mendelian randomization (n=230,947): genetically
    elevated glycine associated with reduced SBP and T2DM risk, but NOT
    with CAD. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08936-1). Mouse
    feeding studies showed no effect on atherosclerosis. Observational
    associations may not be causal. Centered at null with uncertainty.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Extended lifespan in mice. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6516426/).
    Supports glutathione synthesis. GlyNAC combination improved oxidative
    stress and metabolic markers in elderly RCTs.
    (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2022.852569/full).
    Moderate confidence for functional benefits.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May improve sleep quality at higher doses. Supports collagen for
    joint health. GlyNAC improved cognitive endpoints in elderly. Small
    positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: Simplest amino acid, involved in collagen synthesis and glutathione
  production. Extended lifespan in mice.
