    health behaviors, inflammation. Evidence\nquality high from large meta-analyses;
    associative but highly consistent."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 148 studies (n=308,849): OR 1.50 for survival with
    strong vs weak relationships. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20668659/).
    Loneliness meta-analysis (n=3.4M): HR 1.26 for all-cause mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910392/). Effect size comparable
    to smoking cessation. Highly consistent associative evidence.
  mean: 0.70

- outcome: Years of delayed aging

    Social isolation associated with accelerated epigenetic aging and
    shorter telomeres. Blue Zone populations have strong social structures.
    Caregiving stress accelerates aging; positive relationships protective.

  mean: 1.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Social relationships are strongest predictor of happiness in large
    surveys (Harvard Study of Adult Development, World Happiness Report).
