summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies (1,035 participants) examining spirulina supplementation effects on cardiometabolic health in overweight/obese adults. Found spirulina alone reduced body weight, improved lipid profiles, and lowered diastolic blood pressure. Combination with exercise enhanced HDL-C and LDL-C improvements. Optimal dosing: 2-3g powdered spirulina daily for 7-8 weeks.'
