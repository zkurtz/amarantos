summary: Dose-response meta-analysis of 32 RCTs with 1,764 participants examining
  potassium supplementation and blood pressure. Found potassium reduced systolic BP
  by 3.9 mmHg and diastolic BP by 2.4 mmHg. Discovered U-shaped relationship with
  BP benefits peaking around 30 mmol/d supplementation then diminishing at higher
  intakes. Effect more pronounced in hypertensive subjects.
