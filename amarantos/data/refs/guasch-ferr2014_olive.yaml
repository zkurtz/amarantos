summary: Prospective cohort analysis within the PREDIMED trial of 7,216 men and women
  (55-80 years) at high cardiovascular risk followed for median 4.8 years. Higher
  extra-virgin olive oil consumption was associated with 39% lower risk of major cardiovascular
  events (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.85). Non-significant inverse association found for
  overall mortality.
