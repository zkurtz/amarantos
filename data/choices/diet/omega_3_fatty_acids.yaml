domain: diet
name: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA, 1g+/day)
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 42 RCTs, n=176,253 (Mattumpuram et al. 2025).
      Omega-3 supplementation vs placebo:
      - CV mortality: significant reduction (p=0.02)
      - All-cause mortality: NOT significant
      - MI: HR ~0.92 (significant)
      EPA monotherapy more effective than EPA+DHA combination.
      Causal evidence from RCTs, but effect on all-cause mortality null.
      Moderate dose (0.8-1.2g) most effective for MACE reduction.
      Note: increased risk of atrial fibrillation observed.
    mean: 0.96
    std: 0.04
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No direct epigenetic clock studies for omega-3 supplementation found.
      Some evidence for reduced inflammation markers (CRP, IL-6).
      Telomere studies inconclusive.
      Cannot extrapolate from mortality since all-cause effect is null.
      Highly speculative; centered at zero with large uncertainty.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 1.0
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 26 RCTs, n=2,160 (Liao et al. 2019, Transl Psychiatry).
      Omega-3 vs placebo for depression: SMD -0.28 (p=0.004).
      Small but significant effect.
      EPA-rich formulations more effective than DHA-dominant.
      Causal evidence from RCTs.
      More effective as adjunctive therapy than standalone treatment.
      Methodological heterogeneity across trials limits confidence.
    mean: 0.25
    std: 0.15
