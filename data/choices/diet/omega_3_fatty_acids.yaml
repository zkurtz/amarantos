domain: diet
name: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA, 1g+/day)
summary: |
  Omega-3 supplementation (1g+/day) reduces CV mortality and MI risk but has
  null effect on all-cause mortality in RCTs. Small antidepressant effect
  (SMD -0.28). EPA monotherapy more effective than EPA+DHA. Note: may increase
  atrial fibrillation risk. Mixed evidence overall.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 42 RCTs, n=176,253. CV mortality reduced (p=0.02) but
      all-cause mortality NOT significant. MI: HR ~0.92. EPA > EPA+DHA combo.
      Moderate dose (0.8-1.2g) optimal for MACE. Causal evidence from RCTs.
      Increased AFib risk noted. Mattumpuram 2025

  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No direct epigenetic clock studies. Some reduced inflammation markers
      (CRP, IL-6). Telomere studies inconclusive. Cannot extrapolate from
      mortality since all-cause effect is null. Highly speculative; centered
      at zero with large uncertainty.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 1.0
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 26 RCTs, n=2,160. SMD -0.28 (p=0.004) for depression.
      Small but significant. EPA-rich > DHA-dominant. Causal evidence. More
      effective as adjunct than standalone. Liao 2019
