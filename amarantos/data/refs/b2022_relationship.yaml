summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 prospective cohort studies examining chocolate consumption and mortality. The primary study followed 27,111 men from the ATBC cohort. Meta-analysis of 908,390 participants found moderate chocolate consumption associated with lower cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Mediation analysis suggested 4.3% of protective effect operates through blood pressure reduction."
