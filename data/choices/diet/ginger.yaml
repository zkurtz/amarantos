domain: diet
name: Ginger (1-3g/day)
summary: |
  Root with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Meta-analyses show
  significant reduction in CRP, TNF-α, and oxidative stress markers. Improves
  lipid profile and glycemic control. Effects more pronounced with >80 days
  supplementation. No mortality RCTs. Evidence quality moderate for inflammatory
  markers; high heterogeneity in studies.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis shows ginger reduces CRP, TNF-α, and
      IL-6 significantly. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32763761/). Umbrella
      review confirms benefits for inflammatory indices, BP, lipids, and
      glycemic control. (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1619655/full).
      Theoretical CVD benefit via inflammation reduction. Extrapolated estimate.
    mean: 0.96
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Reduces inflammatory markers associated with inflammaging. Antioxidant
      properties. No epigenetic clock studies. Limited human aging data.
      Speculative.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Effective for nausea and may improve digestion. Limited mood data.
      Anti-inflammatory effects may reduce chronic discomfort. Small positive
      effect plausible.
    mean: 0.1
