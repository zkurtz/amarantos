summary: "Retrospective cohort study using NHANES 2007-2018 data of 5,381 adults aged 45+ with osteopenia or osteoporosis, followed for mean 92 months with 1,286 deaths. Found high dietary inflammatory index (DII >= 1.78) associated with 28% increased all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.48). Effect was particularly strong in males (HR 1.38), those under 65 (HR 1.49), and those without cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease."
