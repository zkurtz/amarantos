summary: 'Randomized controlled trial (CALERIE 2) of 218 healthy nonobese adults (mean age 37.9 years, BMI 22-28) randomized 2:1 to 25% caloric restriction vs ad libitum eating for 2 years. CR group achieved significant weight loss (7.6 kg vs 0.4 kg) and showed improved mood, reduced tension, better general health perception, enhanced sexual function, and improved sleep. No negative effects on quality of life were observed.'
