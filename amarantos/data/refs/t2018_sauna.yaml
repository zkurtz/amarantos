summary: 'Prospective cohort study of 1,688 Finnish adults (867 women, 821 men, mean
  age 63) from the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Study with 15-year median follow-up.
  Found strong inverse associations between sauna bathing frequency and cardiovascular
  mortality: 4-7 sessions/week showed HR 0.23 compared to once weekly. Duration also
  mattered: mortality rates were 9.6, 7.6, and 5.1 per 1,000 person-years for <=15,
  16-45, and >45 minutes weekly respectively.'
