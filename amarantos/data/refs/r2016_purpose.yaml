summary: 'Meta-analysis of 10 prospective studies with 136,265 participants examining purpose in life and health outcomes. Found that higher purpose in life associated with 17% reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.83) and 17% reduced cardiovascular events (RR 0.83). Associations consistent across country, questionnaire type, age, and baseline cardiovascular disease status.'
