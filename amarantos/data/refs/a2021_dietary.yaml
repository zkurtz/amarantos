summary: 'Meta-analysis of 17 prospective cohort studies examining the association between green leafy vegetable (GLV) intake and cardiovascular disease incidence. Found a 7% reduction in CVD risk (RR 0.93) with higher GLV consumption, with consistent protective effects for coronary heart disease, stroke, and cerebral infarction. Benefits were similar for both men and women.'
