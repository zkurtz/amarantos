hard_claims:
- summary: Fisetin was the most potent senolytic among ten tested flavonoids and extended
    median and maximum lifespan in mice when administered late in life
  choice: fisetin
  evidence_type: Mechanistic/first-principles
  effects: []
  population: aged mice (85+ weeks, equivalent to ~75 human years)
  notes: Animal study in progeroid Ercc1-/delta and wild-type C57BL/6 mice; reduced
    senescent cells (p16INK4a, p21Cip1) across multiple tissues; no adverse effects
    reported even at high doses; human trials underway
soft_claims:
- summary: Fisetin reduced age-related pathology, oxidative stress, and inflammation
    while improving tissue homeostasis in aged mice
  choice: fisetin
  source_type: research article
  notes: Natural flavonoid found in strawberries, apples, grapes, onions; validated
    in human adipose tissue explants; safety profile appears favorable

summary: Preclinical study demonstrating fisetin as the most potent senolytic among
  tested flavonoids. In mouse models (progeroid and naturally aged), fisetin treatment
  decreased senescent cell markers across multiple tissues, improved tissue homeostasis,
  reduced age-related pathology, and extended median and maximum lifespan when administered
  late in life. No adverse effects reported.
