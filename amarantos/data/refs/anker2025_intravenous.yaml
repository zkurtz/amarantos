hard_claims:
- summary: Intravenous iron reduces composite endpoint of recurrent heart failure
    hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months
  choice: iron
  evidence_type: Meta-analysis
  effects:
  - outcome: heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality
    mean: 0.72
    std: 0.08673469387755102
  population: heart failure patients with iron deficiency
  sample_size: 7175
  followup_years: 1.0
  notes: 'RR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55-0.89) at 12 months; RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.63-0.97) for
    complete follow-up; 6 trials (FAIR-HF, CONFIRM-HF, AFFIRM-AHF, IRONMAN, HEART-FID,
    FAIR-HF2)'
soft_claims:
- summary: Benefits of IV iron were most pronounced in the first year when the highest
    dose was given
  choice: iron
  source_type: expert opinion
  notes: Women did not benefit in terms of lower rates of death or hospitalization,
    requiring further exploration; no significant difference in safety outcomes including
    all-cause mortality or infections

summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 trials (FAIR-HF, CONFIRM-HF, AFFIRM-AHF,
  IRONMAN, HEART-FID, FAIR-HF2) involving 7,175 heart failure patients with iron deficiency
  examining intravenous iron therapy. Found 28% reduction in recurrent heart failure
  hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months (RR 0.72). Benefits were
  particularly strong in the first year with highest iron doses. Notably, women did
  not benefit from treatment. Confirms Class I guideline recommendations for IV iron
  in heart failure.
