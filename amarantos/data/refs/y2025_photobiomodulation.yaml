summary: 'Umbrella review analyzing 15 meta-analyses covering 204 RCTs with over 9,000 participants across 35 health endpoints. Found PBM showed significant therapeutic effects for 9 conditions with moderate certainty evidence including burning mouth syndrome, knee osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia fatigue, androgenetic alopecia, and age-related cognitive impairment. No outcomes supported by high-certainty evidence.'
