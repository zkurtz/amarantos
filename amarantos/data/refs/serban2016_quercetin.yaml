summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 RCTs (587 patients, 9 treatment arms) examining quercetin effects on blood pressure. Quercetin significantly reduced both systolic BP (WMD -3.04 mmHg, 95% CI -5.75 to -0.33, P=0.028) and diastolic BP (WMD -2.63 mmHg, 95% CI -3.26 to -2.01, P<0.001). Effect was dose-dependent, with doses >=500 mg/day showing greater reductions."
