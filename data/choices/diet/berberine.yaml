domain: diet
name: Berberine (500-1500mg/day)
summary: |
  Plant alkaloid with significant effects on metabolic markers: reduces LDL
  (~0.5mmol/L), triglycerides, fasting glucose, and waist circumference. No
  mortality RCTs. Improves 78% of CVD outcomes and 92% of T2DM outcomes in
  meta-analyses. Generally safe; GI side effects common. Evidence quality is
  low-moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 44 RCTs (n=4,606) shows improved
      lipids and glucose. Dong 2023
      (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711323000740).
      Theoretical CVD benefit via metabolic improvements. Extrapolated estimate
      with high uncertainty.
    mean: 0.95
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Activates AMPK pathway linked to longevity in animal models. Reduces
      inflammation markers. No human aging studies. Speculative.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No direct mood RCTs. May improve energy via glucose regulation in
      diabetics. GI side effects (nausea, constipation) may reduce wellbeing
      in some. Net effect uncertain.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.3
