domain: exercise
name: Cycling (30+ min/day)
summary: |
  Among the best-studied exercises for mortality reduction. Meta-analysis of
  cohorts: 23% lower all-cause mortality, 24% lower CVD mortality with regular
  cycling. UK Biobank: 20% lower all-cause mortality vs car commuters. Dose-
  response linear for all-cause; U-shaped for CVD (~130min/week optimal). Low
  joint impact. Benefits independent of air pollution exposure. Evidence quality
  high.

      2021 dose-response meta-analysis: RR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67-0.88) for highest
      vs lowest cycling. 9% reduction per 5 MET-h/week increase.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33774807/). UK Census cohort: HR 0.80
      for all-cause, HR 0.76 for CVD mortality in bike commuters.

      Associative evidence; highly consistent.

  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Cardiorespiratory fitness gain associated with biological age reduction.
      Low-impact preserves joint health. Regular cyclists show slower functional
      decline. No epigenetic clock studies specific to cycling. Strong
      biological plausibility.
    mean: 1.5
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Outdoor cycling associated with improved mood and stress reduction.
      Active commuting associated with better mental health outcomes. May
      enhance social connections. Moderate positive effect likely.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
