summary: 'Case series of 23 patients (25 SFAs) treated with retrograde transpedal approach for chronic total occlusions of the superficial femoral artery. The novel re-route technique for re-entry achieved 100% success rate in 7 patients. Overall primary patency rate was 78% at mean follow-up of 15.3 months. Authors conclude this is a safe and successful technique with low complication risk.'
