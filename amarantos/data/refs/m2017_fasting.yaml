summary: 'Randomized controlled trial of 100 healthy participants testing a fasting-mimicking diet (5 consecutive days per month for 3 months). Found significant reductions in body weight, trunk and total body fat, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, fasting glucose, IGF-1, and CRP. Those with elevated baseline risk factors showed greater improvements. No serious adverse effects reported.'
