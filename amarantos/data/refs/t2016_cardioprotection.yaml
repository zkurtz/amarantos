summary: "Combined animal and human study examining spermidine effects on cardioprotection and longevity. In mice, late-in-life spermidine supplementation extended median lifespan by approximately 10% and reduced cardiac hypertrophy while preserving diastolic function. Human epidemiological data from the Bruneck Study showed dietary spermidine correlated with approximately 40% reduction in fatal heart failure risk. Mechanisms involve enhanced autophagy and mitophagy."
