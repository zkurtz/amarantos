  description: "Recommended: avoid high-dose supplementation. Fat-soluble antioxidant.
    CAUTION: Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (n=136K) found\nhigh-dose (≥400 IU/day) supplementation
    may INCREASE all-cause mortality.\nHOPE trial: no CVD prevention, may increase
    heart failure. Large RCTs show\nno benefit for cancer or CVD. Dietary sources
    (nuts, seeds, oils) sufficient\nfor most. Supplementation not recommended. Evidence
    quality high for harm."

  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (n=135,967): high-dose (≥400 IU/day) associated
    with increased all-cause mortality in dose-dependent manner.
    (https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-142-1-200501040-00110).
    HOPE trial: no CVD benefit, may increase heart failure risk.
    (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200001203420302). Do not
    supplement with high doses.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
  evidence: |
    Antioxidant effects not translated to human longevity benefits. RCTs
    show no anti-aging effects. May interfere with beneficial oxidative
    signaling. No benefit from supplementation.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.2
  evidence: |
    No mood benefits demonstrated. High doses may cause GI distress. No
    evidence for positive effect; possible negative.
