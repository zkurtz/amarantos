  description: "Recommended: 2+ hours/week outdoors. Time in natural environments
    including parks, forests, and green spaces.\nLarge studies: 120+ min/week in nature
    associated with significantly better\nhealth and wellbeing. Forest bathing (shinrin-yoku)
    reduces cortisol and\nBP. Green space access associated with lower mortality.
    Mechanisms include\nstress reduction, physical activity, air quality. Evidence
    quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis (n=8M): highest green space exposure HR 0.84 for
    all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30695701/).
    UK study (n=19,806): 120+ min/week nature associated with good health
    and wellbeing. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31197192/). Benefits
    plateau around 200-300 min/week. Associative; confounded with SES.
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Forest bathing reduces cortisol, BP, and inflammatory markers.
    Chronic stress accelerates aging; nature exposure may buffer.
    Urban green space associated with better cognitive aging.
    Moderate indirect evidence.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Strong evidence: time in nature improves mood, reduces stress and
    anxiety, improves attention restoration. Meta-analysis supports
    mental health benefits of green space. 120+ min/week threshold
    for significant benefit. Moderate-large positive effect.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.3
summary: "Time in natural environments including parks, forests, and green spaces.
  Large studies: 120+ min/week in nature associated with significantly better\nhealth
  and wellbeing."
