summary: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 20 prospective studies
  (up to 819,448 participants, 85,870 deaths) examining nut consumption and mortality/disease
  risk. Found 22% reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.78), 21% reduction in cardiovascular
  disease (RR 0.79), and 29% reduction in coronary heart disease (RR 0.71) per 28g/day
  nut intake. Also found protective associations for respiratory disease mortality
  (RR 0.48) and diabetes mortality (RR 0.61). Estimated 4.4 million premature deaths
  attributable to nut intake below 20g/day.
