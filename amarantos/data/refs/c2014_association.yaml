summary: "Cumulative meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled trials (57,952 participants, follow-up 0.7-7.3 years) examining B vitamin supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes. Found no significant effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), total mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Authors conclude routine B vitamin supplementation for cardiovascular prevention lacks clinical justification."
