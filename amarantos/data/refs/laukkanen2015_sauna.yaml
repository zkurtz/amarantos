summary: 'Prospective cohort study of 2,315 middle-aged Finnish men followed for a median of 20.7 years examining the association between sauna bathing frequency/duration and cardiovascular mortality. Found that increased frequency (4-7 sessions/week vs 1/week) and longer duration (>19 min vs <11 min) of sauna bathing were associated with substantially reduced risks of sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality.'
