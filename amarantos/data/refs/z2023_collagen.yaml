summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining collagen peptide supplementation effects on cardiovascular markers. Found reductions in systolic blood pressure (-5.04 mmHg), LDL cholesterol (-4.09 mg/dl), and fat mass (-1.21 kg), with increased fat-free mass (+1.49%). No significant effects on glycemic markers.'
