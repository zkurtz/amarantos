  description: "Recommended: adequate intake 425-550mg/day. Essential nutrient for
    cell membranes, neurotransmitters, and methylation.\nDeficiency linked to NAFLD
    and cognitive issues. However, 2024 meta-analysis\nfound HIGHER choline intake
    associated with increased all-cause and CVD mortality,\npossibly via TMAO production.
    Aim for adequate intake from food; supplementation\nmay be harmful. U-shaped risk
    curve likely."

- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2024 dose-response meta-analysis of 6 cohorts (n=482,778): each 100mg/day
    increase associated with 6% higher all-cause mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI:
    1.03-1.10) and 11% higher CVD mortality (RR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.16).
    (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0271531724001143).
    TMAO pathway may mediate increased risk. Associative evidence; optimal
    intake may be adequate (not high) levels.

    Important for brain health and preventing cognitive decline. Framingham
    study linked higher choline to better cognitive performance.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3252552/). May protect against
    dementia but high intake risks offset benefits. Uncertain net effect.

    Precursor to acetylcholine; may support memory and cognitive function.
    Deficiency causes fatigue and cognitive issues. Citicoline shows cognitive
    benefits in disease states. Effect in healthy individuals unclear.

summary: Essential nutrient for cell membranes, neurotransmitters, and
  methylation. Deficiency linked to NAFLD and cognitive issues.
