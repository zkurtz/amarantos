  notes: "Double-blind pilot study. Acute improvement in reaction time (737.70 to 688.05 msec, P=0.005). Trend toward chronic stress reduction at 28 days (P=0.051). Study likely underpowered."

summary: "Double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial in 41 healthy young adults examining acute (60 min) and chronic (28 day) effects of Lion's Mane mushroom on cognition, stress, and mood. Acute supplementation significantly improved Stroop task reaction time (P=0.005). Trend toward reduced subjective stress at 28 days (P=0.051). Authors note study was likely underpowered."
