  description: "Recommended: B6, B12, Folate. Despite lowering homocysteine (a CVD
    risk marker), RCTs show NO reduction in\ncardiovascular events or mortality. Meta-analysis
    of 24 RCTs (n=57,952) found\nnull effect on MACE, MI, stroke, or death. May benefit
    stroke prevention\nmarginally. Deficiency should be corrected but supplementation
    in replete\nindividuals appears ineffective for CVD prevention."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 24 RCTs, n=57,952. B vitamins vs placebo: RR 1.01
    (95% CI: 0.97-1.05) for total mortality. No benefit for MACE, MI, or
    cardiac death. Causal evidence from RCTs. Huang 2014
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4169527/). HOPE-2 trial
    (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa060900).
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.02
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No evidence that B vitamin supplementation slows aging in replete
    individuals. Deficiency accelerates cognitive decline. No epigenetic
    clock data for supplementation.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    B12 deficiency causes fatigue and neurological symptoms. Supplementation
    in deficient individuals improves symptoms. No benefit shown for mood in
    replete individuals in RCTs.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.2
summary: "Despite lowering homocysteine (a CVD risk marker), RCTs show NO reduction
  in\ncardiovascular events or mortality. Meta-analysis of 24 RCTs (n=57,952) found\n\
  null effect on MACE, MI, stroke, or death."
