summary: Meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials involving 797 subjects examining
  chlorella supplementation effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Found significant
  reductions in total cholesterol (-9.09 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (-8.32 mg/dl), systolic
  blood pressure (-4.51 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (-1.64 mmHg), and fasting
  blood glucose (-4.23 mg/dl). No significant effects on triglycerides, HDL, or BMI.
  Best results with doses exceeding 4g/day for 8+ weeks.
