summary: Case report of a newborn presenting with a large cardiac rhabdomyoma causing
  moderate subaortic stenosis. Follow-up showed spontaneous regression of the tumor.
  Authors conclude medical follow-up should be preferred treatment for asymptomatic
  cases, as rhabdomyomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors in childhood and
  may resolve naturally.
