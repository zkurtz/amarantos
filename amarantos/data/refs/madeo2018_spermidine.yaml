hard_claims: []
soft_claims:
- summary: Dietary polyamine uptake correlates with reduced cardiovascular and cancer-related
    mortality in human epidemiological studies
  choice: spermidine
  source_type: review
  notes: Spermidine induces autophagy, preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits
    anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence; functions as
    caloric restriction mimetic
- summary: Spermidine has prominent cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects and
    stimulates anticancer immunosurveillance in rodent models
  choice: spermidine
  source_type: review
  notes: Mechanism involves protein deacetylation and functional autophagy; spermidine
    already present in daily human nutrition making clinical trials feasible

summary: Comprehensive review of spermidine as a caloric restriction mimetic. Discusses
  cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects in rodent models, correlation of dietary
  polyamine intake with reduced cardiovascular and cancer mortality in epidemiological
  studies, and mechanisms involving autophagy induction and mitochondrial preservation.
