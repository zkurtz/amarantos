summary: Post hoc analysis of PLCO cancer screening trial examining chocolate consumption
  and mortality in 91,891 US adults aged 55-74 over 13.5 years (19,586 deaths). Found
  nonlinear inverse relationship with lowest mortality risk at approximately 0.7 servings
  weekly. Enhanced protective associations for CVD and Alzheimer's disease mortality,
  especially among never-smokers.
