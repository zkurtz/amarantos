name: Optimized Caffeine Timing
summary: "Caffeine has 5-6 hour half-life; afternoon intake impairs sleep architecture\n\
  even without subjective awareness. Coffee itself associated with 12-15% lower\n\
  mortality in observational studies."

  description: "Recommended: morning only, avoid afternoon. Caffeine has 5-6 hour
    half-life; afternoon intake impairs sleep architecture\neven without subjective
    awareness. Coffee itself associated with 12-15% lower\nmortality in observational
    studies. Timing optimization maintains benefits\nwhile protecting sleep. Morning
    cortisol alignment recommended. Evidence\nquality moderate; coffee benefit strong,
    timing effects from sleep science."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.88
  std: 0.05
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis: 3-4 cups coffee/day associated with 12-15% lower
    all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055709/).
    Benefits persist for decaf (polyphenols). Caffeine timing primarily
    affects sleep; sleep affects mortality. Optimal timing supports
    mortality benefit through sleep protection.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.5
  evidence: |
    Coffee consumption associated with longer telomeres in observational
    studies. Polyphenols have antioxidant effects. Caffeine may enhance
    autophagy. Sleep disruption from poor timing accelerates aging.
    Net effect positive with proper timing.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    Morning caffeine improves alertness and mood. Afternoon caffeine
    impairs sleep quality, reducing next-day wellbeing. Optimized timing
    provides alertness benefits without sleep cost. Moderate positive
    effect with good timing practices.
