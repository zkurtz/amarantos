- summary: Spirulina supplementation significantly reduced body weight in overweight/obese
    adults
  choice: spirulina
  evidence_type: Meta-analysis
  effects:
  - outcome: body weight
    mean: -0.3
    std: 0.075
  population: overweight and obese adults
  sample_size: 1035
  notes: 23 studies; powdered spirulina outperformed tablets/capsules; 2-3g daily
    for 7-8 weeks optimal
- summary: Spirulina supplementation significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure
  choice: spirulina
  evidence_type: Meta-analysis
  effects:
  - outcome: diastolic blood pressure
    mean: -0.73
    std: 0.1825
  population: overweight and obese adults
  sample_size: 1035
  notes: Also improved lipid profiles (reduced TC, TG, LDL-C; raised HDL-C); greater
    benefits in T2D or hypertensive patients
- summary: Spirulina combined with exercise enhanced HDL-C improvements
  choice: spirulina
  evidence_type: Meta-analysis
  effects:
  - outcome: HDL cholesterol
    mean: 1.08
    std: 0.27
  population: overweight and obese adults
  sample_size: 1035

summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies (1,035 participants) examining
  spirulina supplementation effects on cardiometabolic health in overweight/obese
  adults. Found spirulina alone reduced body weight, improved lipid profiles, and
  lowered diastolic blood pressure. Combination with exercise enhanced HDL-C and LDL-C
  improvements. Optimal dosing: 2-3g powdered spirulina daily for 7-8 weeks.'
