domain: diet
name: Magnesium (300-400mg/day)
summary: |
  Essential mineral involved in 300+ enzymatic reactions. Dietary intake
  associated with 6% lower all-cause mortality per 100mg/day; supplementation
  reduces BP by 2-3mmHg (RCTs). Greater benefits in hypertensives and those with
  hypomagnesemia (-7.7mmHg SBP). Many adults deficient. Dietary sources preferred.
  Evidence quality moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Dose-response meta-analysis: each 100mg/day dietary magnesium associated
      with 6% lower all-cause mortality and 5% lower cancer mortality.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33684200/). Supplementation not shown
      to reduce mortality in RCTs. 2024 umbrella meta-analysis: supplementation
      reduces SBP by -1.25mmHg, DBP by -1.40mmHg.
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11401110/). Dietary benefits;
      supplementation for BP only.
    mean: 0.94
    std: 0.05
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Involved in DNA repair and cellular energy production. Deficiency
      associated with accelerated aging. May support mitochondrial function.
      No epigenetic clock studies. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Deficiency causes fatigue, muscle cramps, and anxiety. Supplementation
      may improve sleep and reduce anxiety in deficient individuals. Limited
      RCT evidence in replete individuals.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
