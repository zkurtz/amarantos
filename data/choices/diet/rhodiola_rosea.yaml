  description: "Recommended: 200-600mg/day. Adaptogenic herb approved by EMA for stress-related
    symptoms. Systematic review\nof 11 RCTs suggests benefits for physical/mental
    fatigue, but methodological\nflaws limit conclusions. May improve attention and
    reduce burnout. Effects via\nmodulating neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin).
    No mortality data. Evidence\nquality low; heterogeneous study designs."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality or cardiovascular studies. Adaptogenic mechanisms may
    reduce stress-related health impacts indirectly. Purely speculative
    for mortality effect.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. May protect against
    stress-induced aging. No human longevity studies. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Systematic review of 11 RCTs suggests benefits for fatigue and stress.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3541197/). RCT: improved
    attention and reduced burnout scores.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9228580/). Methodological
    limitations. Moderate positive effect possible.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.4
summary: "Adaptogenic herb approved by EMA for stress-related symptoms. Systematic
  review\nof 11 RCTs suggests benefits for physical/mental fatigue, but methodological\n\
  flaws limit conclusions."
