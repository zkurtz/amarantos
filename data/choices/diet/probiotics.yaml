domain: diet
name: Probiotics (daily, ≥10¹⁰ CFU)
summary: |
  Live microorganisms that modulate gut microbiome. Meta-analyses show reduced
  body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and improved lipid profiles in
  overweight/obese. May lower BP, glucose, and inflammatory markers (TNF-α). No
  direct mortality RCTs. Benefits most pronounced in those with elevated baseline
  cardiometabolic risk. Strain-specific effects. Evidence quality moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 26 RCTs (n=1,720) in overweight/obese:
      reduced weight (-0.7kg), BMI, waist circumference, TNF-α, insulin, TC, LDL.
      (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561421003198).
      Effects require ≥10¹⁰ CFU for ≥8 weeks. Theoretical CVD benefit via risk
      factor improvement; extrapolated estimate.
    mean: 0.96
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Gut microbiome composition changes with aging. Probiotics may improve
      microbial diversity and reduce inflammation. No epigenetic clock studies.
      Speculative.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Gut-brain axis research suggests microbiome affects mood. Some strains
      (psychobiotics) show anxiolytic effects in RCTs. Limited but growing
      evidence. Small positive effect plausible.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
