- summary: 8% glycine-supplemented diet extended median lifespan in male mice by approximately
    4-6%
  choice: glycine
  evidence_type: Randomized controlled trial
  effects:
  - outcome: median lifespan
    mean: 1.05
    std: 0.2625
  population: genetically heterogeneous mice (male)
  notes: NIA Interventions Testing Program across 3 sites; p=0.002; treatment started
    at 9 months of age; reduced pulmonary adenocarcinoma deaths
- summary: 8% glycine-supplemented diet extended median lifespan in female mice by
    approximately 4-6%
  choice: glycine
  evidence_type: Randomized controlled trial
  effects:
  - outcome: median lifespan
    mean: 1.04
    std: 0.26
  population: genetically heterogeneous mice (female)
  notes: NIA Interventions Testing Program; p=0.006; serum glycine levels sixfold
    higher than controls

summary: NIA Interventions Testing Program study across 3 research sites examining
  glycine supplementation in genetically heterogeneous mice. 8% glycine diet (started
  at 9 months) extended median lifespan by approximately 4-6% in both sexes (p=0.002
  males, p=0.006 females). Glycine-treated mice less likely to die from pulmonary
  adenocarcinoma. Effects described as modest.
