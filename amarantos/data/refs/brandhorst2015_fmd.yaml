summary: "Randomized controlled trial examining effects of periodic fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) in yeast, mice, and humans. In mice, bi-monthly 4-day FMD cycles extended median lifespan, lowered visceral fat, reduced cancer incidence, and improved motor coordination and cognitive function. FMD triggered organ shrinkage followed by regeneration upon refeeding, with elevated stem/progenitor cells. Pilot human trial (5-day FMD monthly for 3 months) showed decreased risk factors for aging, diabetes, CVD, and cancer without major adverse effects."
