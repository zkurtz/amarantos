  description: "Recommended: 3+ servings/week. Broccoli, kale, cabbage, Brussels sprouts
    rich in sulforaphane and\nisothiocyanates. Large meta-analyses show inverse association
    with all-cause\nmortality, CVD mortality, and cancer incidence. 23% lower cancer
    risk. Dose-\nresponse relationship observed. Among the most consistently beneficial
    food\ngroups. Evidence quality high (large cohort studies)."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.88

  evidence: |
    2017 meta-analysis of 95 studies: cruciferous vegetables inversely
    associated with CVD and all-cause mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28338764/). Shanghai cohort (n=134,796):
    dose-response pattern for cruciferous and mortality.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3127519/). Japanese cohort
    (n=88,184): higher intake associated with reduced all-cause mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29739681/). Associative evidence;
    consistent across populations.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.7
  evidence: |
    Sulforaphane activates Nrf2 pathway, reduces oxidative stress and
    inflammation. Animal studies show lifespan benefits. No human epigenetic
    clock data. Strong biological plausibility for anti-aging effects.
    Moderate confidence.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. Part of healthy dietary patterns associated with
    better mood. May reduce inflammation linked to depression. Indirect
    evidence only.
