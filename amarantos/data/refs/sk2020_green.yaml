summary: "Review of epidemiological evidence from 82 meta-analyses on green tea consumption and health outcomes. Found inverse associations between green tea intake and cardiovascular disease mortality (RR 0.72), stroke incidence (17-36% reduction), and several cancers. Mixed results for diabetes prevention. Study population includes general adults from observational studies."
