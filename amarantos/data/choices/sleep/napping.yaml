  description: "Recommended: <30min, early afternoon. Napping shows complex dose-response.
    Meta-analysis: naps >60min associated\nwith 30% higher mortality, likely marker
    of poor nocturnal sleep or illness.\nShort naps (<30min) may be neutral or slightly
    beneficial. Afternoon timing\naligns with circadian dip. Benefits may depend on
    context (siesta cultures,\nsleep debt). Evidence quality low-moderate; confounding
    concerns."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis (n=313,651): napping >60min HR 1.30 (95% CI: 1.10-1.54)
    for all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32741032/).
    Short naps (<30min) showed no significant mortality association.
    Long naps may indicate underlying health issues or poor nocturnal
    sleep. Associative evidence with significant confounding concerns.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Brief naps may support memory consolidation and cognitive function.
    No direct aging data. Long naps associated with cognitive decline
    in observational studies (possibly reverse causation). Uncertain.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Short naps improve alertness and performance in experimental studies.
    May reduce afternoon fatigue. Benefits depend on individual sleep
    need and nocturnal sleep quality. Small positive effect for
    short naps in sleep-deprived individuals.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Napping shows complex dose-response. Meta-analysis: naps >60min associated\n\
  with 30% higher mortality, likely marker of poor nocturnal sleep or illness."
