  - outcome: skeletal muscle index

  population: adults aged 60+ years (mean age 60.9-83 years)

  notes: 10 RCTs (6 NMN, 4 NR studies). Dosages 250-2000 mg/day for 3-24 weeks. No
    significant effects on handgrip strength or gait speed either.

    disease patients, but worsened physical performance in those with mild cognitive

summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (6
  NMN, 4 NR) examining effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide and riboside supplementation
  on skeletal muscle outcomes in adults aged 60+. Dosages ranged 250-2000 mg/day for
  3-24 weeks. Found no significant effects on skeletal muscle index (MD -0.42), handgrip
  strength, or gait speed (MD -0.01). Concluded current evidence does not support
  NMN/NR supplementation for preserving muscle mass and function in older adults.
