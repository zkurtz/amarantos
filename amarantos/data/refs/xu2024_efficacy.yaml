summary: 'Meta-analysis of 33 randomized controlled trials evaluating CoQ10 efficacy and safety in heart failure. Found significant reductions in all-cause mortality (RR 0.64), heart failure hospitalization (RR 0.50), NYHA classification, and BNP levels, with improvements in LVEF and 6-minute walk test, without major adverse effects.'
