  description: "Recommended: 2x/week, ~60 min total. Regular resistance training (2x/week,
    ~60 min total) is associated with\n~20% lower all-cause mortality and significant
    antidepressant effects.\nDose-response is U-shaped: maximum benefit around 60
    min/week with\ndiminishing returns above 130 min/week. Strong RCT evidence for
    mood benefits."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 11 studies, n=370,256. Any RT vs none: HR 0.79
    (95% CI: 0.69-0.91). U-shaped dose-response: max benefit ~60 min/week
    (RR 0.73). Mostly cohort studies; associative evidence. Saeidifard 2019
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104484/). Shailendra 2022

  mean: 0.79
  std: 0.056
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Limited direct evidence on biological age markers. RT preserves muscle
    mass, bone density, functional capacity. Some telomere maintenance data.
    Extrapolated from mortality: 21% reduction ~ 2-3 years. Moderate
    confidence given strong mechanistic plausibility.
  mean: 2.0
  std: 1.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    JAMA Psychiatry meta-analysis of 33 RCTs, n=1,877. RT vs control:
    SMD -0.66 (95% CI: -0.48 to -0.83) for depression. NNT=4. Causal
    evidence from RCTs. Effects independent of strength gains. Gordon 2018

summary: "Regular resistance training (2x/week, ~60 min total) is associated with\n\
  ~20% lower all-cause mortality and significant antidepressant effects. Dose-response
  is U-shaped: maximum benefit around 60 min/week with\ndiminishing returns above
  130 min/week."
