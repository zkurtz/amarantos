summary: Prospective cohort study (Ohsaki Study) of 43,391 Japanese adults followed
  for 7 years examining the relationship between ikigai (sense of life worth living)
  and mortality. Found that individuals lacking ikigai had significantly elevated
  all-cause mortality (HR 1.5) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.6). No significant
  association was found with cancer mortality. 3,048 participants died during follow-up.
