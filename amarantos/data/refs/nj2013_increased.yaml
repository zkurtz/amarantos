summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (1,606 participants) and 11
  cohort studies (127,038 participants) examining increased potassium intake effects
  on cardiovascular risk. Found 24% reduced stroke risk (RR 0.76) and 3.49 mm Hg systolic
  blood pressure reduction in hypertensive adults. No significant adverse effects
  on renal function observed.
