  description: "Recommended: dietary, ~10-20mg/day from food. Polyamine that induces
    autophagy, a key longevity mechanism. NHANES cohort:\nhighest intake associated
    with lower all-cause and CVD mortality. Bruneck Study:\n~40% lower heart failure
    risk with highest intake. Extends lifespan in yeast,\nflies, mice. 2024 Nature
    Cell Biology: essential for fasting-mediated autophagy.\nFound in aged cheese,
    mushrooms, legumes, whole grains. Evidence quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    NHANES analysis (n=23,894): higher dietary spermidine associated with
    reduced CVD and all-cause mortality.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9554131/). Bruneck Study:
    ~40% lower heart failure risk with high intake. Independent cohort
    (n=1,770): confirmed mortality association.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6287690/). Associative evidence.
  mean: 0.88

    Primary mechanism is autophagy induction. 2024 Nature Cell Biology:
    spermidine essential for fasting-induced autophagy and lifespan extension.
    (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-024-01468-x). Extends lifespan in
    multiple species. Cardioprotective in mice.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5806691/). Strong mechanistic
    rationale.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May improve cognitive function via autophagy. No direct mood RCTs.
    Part of healthy dietary patterns. Indirect evidence only.

summary: "Polyamine that induces autophagy, a key longevity mechanism. NHANES cohort:\n\
  highest intake associated with lower all-cause and CVD mortality."
