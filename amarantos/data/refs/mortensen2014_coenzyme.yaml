summary: "Q-SYMBIO trial: randomized double-blind RCT of CoQ10 (300mg/day) in 420 patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure over 2 years. Found 50% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.50), 43% reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and 44% reduction in all-cause mortality. Significant improvement in NYHA functional class."
