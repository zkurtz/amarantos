  description: "Recommended: <1 drink/day. Alcohol's J-curve for mortality now disputed.
    Large Mendelian randomization\nstudies: no safe level for overall health. Previous
    \"protective\" effects\nlikely confounded by sick quitters and healthy drinker
    bias. GBD 2020:\nalcohol is leading risk factor for 15-49 age group. Light drinking
    may\nhave small CVD benefit but increases cancer risk. Evidence quality high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Global Burden of Disease 2020: alcohol attributable to 2.8M deaths/year,
    leading risk factor ages 15-49. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30146330/).
    Mendelian randomization: no J-curve; any alcohol increases BP and stroke
    risk. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29955838/). Light drinking may
    have small CVD benefit (HR 0.90) but net effect unclear given cancer risk.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Alcohol accelerates epigenetic aging in dose-dependent manner.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36698148/). Liver aging, brain
    volume reduction. Abstinence or minimal intake optimal for aging.
    Strong evidence for accelerated aging with regular use.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Social drinking provides relaxation and social facilitation. However,
    alcohol is depressant; heavy use worsens mental health. Abstinence
    often improves sleep and mood. Individual variation high. For
    abstinence/minimal: small net positive after adjustment period.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.4
summary: "Alcohol's J-curve for mortality now disputed. Large Mendelian randomization\n\
  studies: no safe level for overall health."
