summary: |
  Rich in ALA omega-3, fiber, and lignans. Meta-analysis of chia: reduced TG
  (-9-13mg/dL), LDL (-5mg/dL), SBP (-3mmHg). Flax: 0-18% LDL reduction in studies.
  ALA conversion to EPA/DHA is low (5-8% EPA, 0.5% DHA). NHS: highest ALA intake
  associated with 40% lower sudden cardiac death. Evidence quality moderate;
  direct mortality data limited.
