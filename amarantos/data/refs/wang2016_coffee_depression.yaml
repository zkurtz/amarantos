summary: "Meta-analysis of 11 observational studies examining coffee/caffeine consumption and depression risk. Coffee analysis (7 studies, 330,677 participants) found 24% reduced depression risk (RR 0.757); linear dose-response showed 8% risk reduction per cup/day. Caffeine analysis (8 studies, 38,223 participants) found 28% reduced depression risk (RR 0.721) with nonlinear relationship showing significant benefit at 68-509 mg/day consumption."
