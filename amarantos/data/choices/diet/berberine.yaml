  description: "Recommended: 500-1500mg/day. Plant alkaloid with significant effects
    on metabolic markers: reduces LDL\n(~0.5mmol/L), triglycerides, fasting glucose,
    and waist circumference. No\nmortality RCTs. Improves 78% of CVD outcomes and
    92% of T2DM outcomes in\nmeta-analyses. Generally safe; GI side effects common.
    Evidence quality is\nlow-moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 44 RCTs (n=4,606) shows improved
    lipids and glucose. Dong 2023
    (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711323000740).
    Theoretical CVD benefit via metabolic improvements. Extrapolated estimate
    with high uncertainty.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Activates AMPK pathway linked to longevity in animal models. Reduces
    inflammation markers. No human aging studies. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. May improve energy via glucose regulation in
    diabetics. GI side effects (nausea, constipation) may reduce wellbeing
    in some. Net effect uncertain.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
summary: "Plant alkaloid with significant effects on metabolic markers: reduces LDL\n\
  (~0.5mmol/L), triglycerides, fasting glucose, and waist circumference. No\nmortality
  RCTs."
