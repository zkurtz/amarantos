summary: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining vitamin D supplementation
  effects on cancer outcomes with 3-10 years follow-up. Found vitamin D significantly
  reduced cancer mortality by 13% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.96; 5 trials, 1,591 deaths)
  but did not reduce cancer incidence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.03; 10 trials, 6,537
  cases). Daily dosing regimens showed greater mortality benefit than infrequent bolus
  dosing.
