domain: diet
name: Avocado (2+ servings/week)
summary: |
  Associated with 16% lower CVD risk and 21% lower CHD risk in large cohorts.
  Rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, potassium. RCTs show modest LDL reduction
  (~4-9mg/dL). No direct mortality trials. Evidence quality low-moderate due to
  observational designs and small RCTs.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Prospective cohort, n=110,487 over 30 years. ≥2 servings/week vs rarely:
      HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75-0.95) for CVD, HR 0.79 for CHD. Associative evidence.
      Pacheco 2022 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35352568/). No all-cause
      mortality data; estimate based on CVD reduction.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.04
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No epigenetic clock studies. Rich in antioxidants and healthy fats.
      Extrapolated from CVD risk reduction. Speculative.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No direct mood RCTs for avocado. Contains folate and healthy fats linked
      to brain health. Insufficient evidence for effect estimate.
