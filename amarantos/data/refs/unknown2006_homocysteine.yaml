  notes: HOPE-2 trial; 2.5mg folic acid + 50mg B6 + 1mg B12 daily; homocysteine decreased

summary: HOPE-2 randomized controlled trial of 5,522 patients aged 55+ with vascular
  disease or diabetes, randomized to daily folic acid (2.5mg) + vitamin B6 (50mg)
  + vitamin B12 (1mg) or placebo for 5 years. Despite effectively lowering homocysteine
  levels (decreased 2.4 umol/L in treatment vs increased 0.8 umol/L in placebo), no
  significant reduction in major cardiovascular events (18.8% vs 19.8%, RR 0.95, p=0.41).
  Results do not support B vitamin supplementation for cardiovascular prevention.
