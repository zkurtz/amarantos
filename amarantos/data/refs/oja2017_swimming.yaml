summary: Pooled cohort study of 80,306 British adults (54% women, mean age 52) examining
  sport participation and mortality. Swimming showed 28% reduced all-cause mortality
  (HR 0.72) and 41% reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.59) compared to non-swimmers.
  Among six sport types examined, swimming ranked among the most protective activities.
