  description: "Recommended: 55-200mcg/day, adequate. Trace mineral essential for
    antioxidant defense. Meta-analysis of 43 RCTs:\nselenium alone shows NO effect
    on CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality. However,\nwhen part of antioxidant mixtures,
    associated with 23% lower CVD mortality and\n10% lower all-cause mortality. U-shaped
    risk curve; both deficiency and excess\nharmful. Excess may increase prostate
    cancer mortality. Evidence mixed."

    Jenkins 2020 meta-analysis of 43 RCTs: selenium alone NS for mortality.
    When selenium part of antioxidant mix: RR 0.77 for CVD mortality, RR 0.90
    for all-cause mortality. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7727482/).

  evidence: |
    Essential for selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense. Deficiency
    accelerates aging. No benefit from supplementation in replete individuals.
    No epigenetic clock studies. Speculative.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    Deficiency causes fatigue and thyroid dysfunction. Supplementation in
    deficient individuals may improve energy. No benefit in replete
    individuals.
