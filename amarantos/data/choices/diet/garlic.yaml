  description: "Recommended: 1+ cloves/day or aged extract. Allium vegetable with
    cardiovascular benefits. Meta-analyses show significant\nBP reduction: -8.3mmHg
    SBP, -5.5mmHg DBP in hypertensives, comparable to\nmedications. Estimated 16-40%
    CVD risk reduction from BP effects. Aged garlic\nextract well-studied. Benefits
    strongest in hypertensives. Evidence quality\nmoderate for BP; no direct mortality
    RCTs."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 12 trials (n=553): garlic reduces
    SBP by 8.3mmHg and DBP by 5.5mmHg in hypertensives.
    (https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(23)00519-9/fulltext).
    Estimated 16-40% CVD risk reduction from BP reduction alone.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8031974/). Causal evidence
    for BP; mortality extrapolated.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Contains sulfur compounds with antioxidant properties. May reduce
    oxidative stress and improve vascular function. No epigenetic clock
    studies. Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. May cause GI discomfort and bad breath in some.
    Immune support claims not well substantiated for wellbeing. Uncertain.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
summary: "Allium vegetable with cardiovascular benefits. Meta-analyses show significant\n\
  BP reduction: -8.3mmHg SBP, -5.5mmHg DBP in hypertensives, comparable to\nmedications."
