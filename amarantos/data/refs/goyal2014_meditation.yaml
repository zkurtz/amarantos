summary: Johns Hopkins meta-analysis of 47 RCTs with 3,515 participants examining
  meditation for psychological stress. Found moderate evidence that mindfulness
  meditation improves anxiety, depression, and pain. However, meditation was not
  superior to active treatments like medication or behavioral therapies.
