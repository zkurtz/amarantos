summary: Meta-analysis of 16 prospective studies with over 1.3 million participants
  examining sleep duration and mortality. Both short and long sleep duration are
  independently associated with increased mortality risk, with long sleep showing
  a stronger association (30% increase) than short sleep (12% increase).
