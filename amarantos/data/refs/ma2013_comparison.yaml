summary: "Randomized controlled trial comparing 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to matched active control (Health Enhancement Program) in approximately 47 healthy adults. Found MBSR produced significantly smaller post-stress inflammatory response despite equivalent stress hormone levels, suggesting specific anti-inflammatory benefits beyond general stress reduction."
