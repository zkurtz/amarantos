summary: 'Meta-analysis of 26 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials including 2,160 participants examining omega-3 PUFAs for depression. Found overall beneficial effect (SMD = -0.28, P = 0.004) with EPA-dominant formulations (>=60% EPA) at dosages <=1 g/day showing the strongest effects. DHA-pure formulations showed no significant benefit.'
