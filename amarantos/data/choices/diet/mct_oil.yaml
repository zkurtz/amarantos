  description: "Recommended: 15-30mL/day. Medium-chain triglycerides rapidly converted
    to ketones, providing alternative\nbrain fuel. Meta-analysis shows mild ketosis
    and possible cognitive improvement\nin MCI/AD patients. May enhance working memory
    in older adults. No mortality\ndata. GI side effects common. May increase triglycerides
    in some. Evidence\nquality low for cognition; no CVD data."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.08
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. May increase plasma triglycerides in some individuals,
    which could be harmful for CVD. No cardiovascular outcomes studied.
    Coconut oil (high MCT) used widely without major adverse events. Centered
    at null with uncertainty.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.7
  evidence: |
    May support brain energy metabolism in aging. Meta-analysis shows
    cognitive benefits in MCI/AD. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7050425/).
    2022 review: may enhance working memory in non-demented older adults.
    (https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-022-03521-6).
    Speculative for healthy aging.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    May improve mental clarity via ketones. GI side effects (nausea, cramping)
    common and may reduce wellbeing. Net effect uncertain.
