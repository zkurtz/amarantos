summary: Meta-analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies examining olive oil consumption
  and cardiovascular/mortality outcomes. Found higher olive oil intake associated
  with 15% reduced CVD risk and 17% reduced all-cause mortality in predominantly US
  and European populations, with dose-response benefits plateauing around 20g/day.
