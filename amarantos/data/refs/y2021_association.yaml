summary: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 9 articles (17 studies,
  478,847 participants, 27,860 mortality cases) examining cycling and mortality. Found
  linear inverse relationship for all-cause mortality (9% reduction per 5 MET-h/week)
  and U-shaped pattern for CVD mortality with optimal benefit at approximately 15
  MET-h/week of cycling.
