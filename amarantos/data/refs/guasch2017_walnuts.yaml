summary: 'Prospective cohort study of 210,836 participants from NHS, NHSII, and HPFS with over 5 million person-years follow-up. Walnut consumption (1+ times/week) was associated with 13-19% lower CVD risk and 15-23% lower CHD risk. Total nut consumption (5+ servings/week vs never) associated with 14% lower CVD risk (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93) and 20% lower CHD risk (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.89).'
