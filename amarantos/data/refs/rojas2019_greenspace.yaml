summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 longitudinal cohort studies examining green space exposure and all-cause mortality in over 8.3 million individuals from 7 countries. Found a statistically significant inverse association between residential greenness (measured by NDVI within 500m buffer) and mortality risk (HR 0.96 per 0.1 NDVI increment, 95% CI 0.94-0.97)."
