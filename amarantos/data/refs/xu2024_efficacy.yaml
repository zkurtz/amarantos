summary: Meta-analysis of 33 randomized controlled trials evaluating CoQ10 efficacy
  and safety in heart failure. Found significant reductions in all-cause mortality
  (RR 0.64), heart failure hospitalization (RR 0.50), NYHA classification, and BNP
  levels, with improvements in LVEF and 6-minute walk test, without major adverse
  effects.
