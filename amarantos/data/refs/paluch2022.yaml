- summary: Walking approximately 7,000-8,000 steps daily associated with 45% reduced
    all-cause mortality compared to ~3,500 steps

summary: Meta-analysis of 15 international cohorts with 47,471 adults and 3,013 deaths
  over median 7.1-year follow-up. Found progressive mortality risk reduction with
  increasing daily steps. Benefits plateau at 6,000-8,000 steps for adults 60+ and
  8,000-10,000 steps for younger adults. Stepping intensity showed modest additional
  benefit.
