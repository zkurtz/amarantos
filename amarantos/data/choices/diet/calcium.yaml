  description: "Recommended: 700-1000mg/day. Essential mineral for bone health. Supplementation
    controversial for CVD: some\nmeta-analyses show 15% increased CVD risk (Kim 2021),
    others show null effect.\nDietary calcium preferred over supplements. High doses
    (>1400mg/day) may\nincrease CVD risk. Evidence mixed; no mortality benefit from
    supplementation\nin replete individuals."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Kim 2021 meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (n=43,178): calcium supplements increased
    CVD risk (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25) and CHD risk (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.28).
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33530332/). However, 2023 Calcium Trialists
    meta-analysis of 11 trials found no significant association with MI, stroke,
    or mortality. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10111600/).
    Conflicting causal evidence; centered at null with uncertainty.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No epigenetic clock studies. Adequate calcium important for bone health
    and preventing osteoporosis-related morbidity. No evidence for anti-aging
    effects beyond deficiency correction. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. Deficiency may cause muscle cramps and fatigue.
    Supplementation in replete individuals unlikely to affect wellbeing.
    No evidence for effect.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.2
summary: "Essential mineral for bone health. Supplementation controversial for CVD:
  some\nmeta-analyses show 15% increased CVD risk (Kim 2021), others show null effect."
