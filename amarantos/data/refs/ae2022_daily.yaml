summary: 'Meta-analysis of 15 international cohort studies involving 47,471 adults with 3,013 deaths over median 7.1-year follow-up examining daily steps and all-cause mortality. Found 53% lower mortality risk for highest vs lowest step quartile (HR 0.47). Optimal thresholds were 6,000-8,000 steps/day for adults 60+ and 8,000-10,000 for younger adults, challenging the popular 10,000-step guideline. Stepping intensity also independently associated with lower mortality.'
