summary: Prospective cohort study of over 300,000 commuters in England and Wales using
  linked Census data over 25 years (1991-2011). Cycling to work associated with 20%
  reduced all-cause mortality, 24% reduced cardiovascular mortality, and 16% reduced
  cancer mortality compared to driving. Walking showed weaker associations. Rail commuters
  also showed benefits, likely due to active travel to transit.
