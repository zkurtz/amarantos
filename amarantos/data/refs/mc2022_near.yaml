summary: "Double-blind RCT of 56 adults (ages 25-64) with mild sleep complaints testing 850nm near-infrared light at various doses over 4 weeks. High dose (6.5 J/cm2) improved mood, reduced drowsiness, lowered IFN-gamma cytokine levels, and reduced resting heart rate, but only during winter months. No effects on sleep quality or circadian rhythms."
