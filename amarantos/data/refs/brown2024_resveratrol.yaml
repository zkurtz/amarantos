- summary: Resveratrol shows promise for human health across multiple conditions but
    lacks conclusive clinical evidence for any specific healthcare recommendation
  choice: resveratrol
  source_type: review
  notes: Systematic review of ~200 clinical trials over 20 years across 24+ indications;
    generally well-tolerated up to 1g/day; consistently reduces inflammatory markers
    and improves metabolic dysregulation
- summary: Resveratrol consistently reduces inflammatory markers across clinical trials
  choice: resveratrol
  source_type: review
  notes: Finding replicated across multiple studies; mechanism involves various anti-inflammatory
    pathways
- summary: Large, high-quality clinical trials needed to transition resveratrol from
    supplement to clinical use
  choice: resveratrol
  source_type: expert opinion
  notes: Review identified gaps including lack of consensus treatment regimens, need
    for defined biomarkers, and structural limitations (photoisomerization of trans-resveratrol)

summary: Systematic review compiling nearly 200 clinical trials of resveratrol over
  20 years across at least 24 indications including cancer, menopause, diabetes, metabolic
  syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Finds resveratrol is generally well-tolerated
  at doses up to 1g/day and consistently reduces inflammatory markers and improves
  metabolic dysregulation. However, no conclusive clinical evidence exists to recommend
  resveratrol for any specific condition, and larger high-quality trials are needed.
