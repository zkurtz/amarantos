  description: "Recommended: moderate, 3-4 cups/day. Moderate coffee consumption (3-4
    cups/day) is associated with 15-20% lower\nall-cause mortality and reduced depression
    risk. Effects are observational\nwith possible healthy user bias. Morning consumption
    may be more protective\nthan all-day drinking."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 40 cohort studies, n=3.8M. HR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.88)
    for 3-4 cups/day vs non-drinkers. Associative evidence; healthy user
    bias possible. Poole 2017 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29167102/).
    Morning timing more protective per Eur Heart J 2024
    (https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/46/8/749/7928425).
  mean: 0.83
  std: 0.023
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No direct epigenetic clock studies. Extrapolated from mortality reduction:
    ~17% lower mortality roughly corresponds to 1-2 years using Gompertz
    assumptions. Speculative estimate with high uncertainty.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 1.0
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies, n=346,913. High vs low consumption:
    RR 0.76 for depression. 8% lower risk per cup/day up to ~4 cups.
    Associative evidence. Wang 2016

  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.2
summary: "Moderate coffee consumption (3-4 cups/day) is associated with 15-20% lower\n\
  all-cause mortality and reduced depression risk. Effects are observational\nwith
  possible healthy user bias."
