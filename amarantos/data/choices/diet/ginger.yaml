  description: "Recommended: 1-3g/day. Root with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
    properties. Meta-analyses show\nsignificant reduction in CRP, TNF-α, and oxidative
    stress markers. Improves\nlipid profile and glycemic control. Effects more pronounced
    with >80 days\nsupplementation. No mortality RCTs. Evidence quality moderate for
    inflammatory\nmarkers; high heterogeneity in studies."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis shows ginger reduces CRP, TNF-α, and
    IL-6 significantly. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32763761/). Umbrella
    review confirms benefits for inflammatory indices, BP, lipids, and
    glycemic control. (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1619655/full).
    Theoretical CVD benefit via inflammation reduction. Extrapolated estimate.
  mean: 0.96
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Reduces inflammatory markers associated with inflammaging. Antioxidant
    properties. No epigenetic clock studies. Limited human aging data.
    Speculative.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Effective for nausea and may improve digestion. Limited mood data.
    Anti-inflammatory effects may reduce chronic discomfort. Small positive
    effect plausible.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Root with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Meta-analyses show\n\
  significant reduction in CRP, TNF-α, and oxidative stress markers."
