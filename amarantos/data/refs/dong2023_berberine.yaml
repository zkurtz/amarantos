  choice: berberine

  outcome: "fasting plasma glucose reduction (mmol/L)"
  population: "patients with metabolic disorders including prediabetes and type 2 diabetes"
  sample_size: 3048
  followup_years: null
  notes: "37 RCTs; also reduced HbA1c (-0.63%), 2hPBG (-1.16 mmol/L); mechanism involves AMPK activation; LDL-lowering effects also documented; effects baseline-dependent with stronger effects in those with higher baseline glucose/HbA1c"

summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 RCTs (n=3,048) examining berberine effects on metabolic markers in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Berberine significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (WMD -0.82 mmol/L), HbA1c (-0.63%), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (-1.16 mmol/L). Effects mediated via AMPK activation. Glucose-lowering effects correlated with baseline FPG and HbA1c levels. Safe with no increased hypoglycemia risk.'
