domain: diet
name: Betaine/TMG (2-6g/day)
summary: |
  Effectively lowers homocysteine by ~12% but RCTs show NO reduction in CVD
  events. Doses ≥4g/day increase LDL cholesterol, potentially offsetting any
  benefit. Lower doses (<4g/day) may lower homocysteine without adverse lipid
  effects. Overall, no proven cardiovascular or mortality benefit despite
  homocysteine lowering.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis shows 4-6g/day lowers homocysteine by
      1.23μmol/L (~12%). Olthof 2005
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15916468/). However, homocysteine-
      lowering interventions (B vitamins) failed to reduce CVD events in trials.
      Higher doses raise LDL. Schwab 2021

    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Methyl donor involved in cellular metabolism. No aging studies in humans.
      Theoretical benefit via homocysteine pathway unproven. Speculative.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No mood or wellbeing RCTs. Sometimes taken with NMN/NR for methylation
      support. No direct evidence for subjective benefit.
