summary: Population-based prospective cohort study of 247,696 healthy Korean adults
  aged 40+ with 9.5 years median follow-up. Found that one additional tooth brushing
  per day was associated with 9% lower cardiovascular risk, and regular professional
  dental cleanings reduced CV risk by 14%. Improved oral hygiene behaviors attenuated
  cardiovascular risk from periodontal disease, dental caries, and tooth loss.
