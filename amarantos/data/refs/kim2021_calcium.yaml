summary: Meta-analysis of 13 double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs involving 43,178
  participants examining calcium supplementation and cardiovascular disease risk.
  Found calcium supplements significantly increased CVD risk by 15% (RR 1.15, 95%
  CI 1.06-1.25) and coronary heart disease risk by 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28).
  Results particularly pronounced in healthy postmenopausal women. Suggests caution
  regarding routine calcium supplementation.
