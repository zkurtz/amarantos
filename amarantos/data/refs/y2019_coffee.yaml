summary: Meta-analysis of 40 studies with over 3.8 million subjects and 450,256 deaths
  examining coffee consumption and mortality. Found non-linear inverse associations
  with optimal consumption at 3.5 cups/day for all-cause mortality (RR 0.85), 2.5
  cups/day for CVD mortality (RR 0.83), and 2 cups/day for cancer mortality (RR 0.96).
  Benefits consistent across most demographic factors.
