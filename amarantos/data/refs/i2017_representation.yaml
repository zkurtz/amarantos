- summary: Over one-third of major cerebrovascular disease trials explicitly exclude
    patients with kidney disease

  notes: 135 RCTs analyzed involving nearly 195,000 participants; 48 trials (35.6%)
    excluded kidney disease patients
- summary: Only 3% of cerebrovascular trials reported baseline renal function data
    and none performed subgroup analyses by renal function

  notes: Industry-funded trials had higher exclusion rates (42-48%) compared to academic/government-funded

summary: Systematic review of 135 cerebrovascular disease RCTs examining representation
  of kidney disease patients. Found 35.6% of trials explicitly excluded kidney disease
  patients, with higher exclusion rates in industry-funded trials. Only 3% reported
  baseline renal function and no trials performed subgroup analyses by kidney function
  status. Calls for purposeful efforts to increase kidney disease patient inclusion.
