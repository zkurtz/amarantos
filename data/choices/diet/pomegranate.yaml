domain: diet
name: Pomegranate (240mL juice/day)
summary: |
  Polyphenol-rich fruit with strong antioxidant capacity. Meta-analyses of RCTs
  show significant BP reduction: -5 to -8mmHg SBP, -2 to -3mmHg DBP. Benefits
  greater in hypertensives. No mortality RCTs. Anti-inflammatory and anti-
  atherogenic properties. Sugar content of juice a consideration. Evidence
  quality moderate for BP.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. 2017 meta-analysis of 8 RCTs: pomegranate juice
      reduced SBP by -4.96mmHg and DBP by -2.01mmHg.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27888156/). 2024 meta-analysis of 22
      RCTs: SBP -7.87mmHg, DBP -3.23mmHg.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38410857/). Theoretical CVD benefit
      via BP reduction; extrapolated estimate.
    mean: 0.94
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      High antioxidant capacity. May improve vascular function. Animal studies
      suggest anti-aging effects. Urolithin A (pomegranate metabolite) shows
      promise for mitophagy. No human epigenetic clock data. Speculative.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      May improve exercise performance via nitrate content. Limited mood RCT
      data. Potential sugar content may affect those with metabolic issues.
      Small effect uncertain.
    mean: 0.1
    std: 0.3
