summary: "Cross-sectional study of 521 university students (16-35 years) examining effects of 12-week COVID-19 confinement on circadian rhythm synchronizers and body weight. Found reduced sunlight exposure and sleep duration, increased sedentarism and screen exposure, delayed meal and sleep timing, significant BMI increases, and shift toward evening chronotype. Demonstrates association between disrupted external circadian synchronizers and weight gain."
