  description: "Recommended: 30+ min/day. Among the best-studied exercises for mortality
    reduction. Meta-analysis of\ncohorts: 23% lower all-cause mortality, 24% lower
    CVD mortality with regular\ncycling. UK Biobank: 20% lower all-cause mortality
    vs car commuters. Dose-\nresponse linear for all-cause; U-shaped for CVD (~130min/week
    optimal). Low\njoint impact. Benefits independent of air pollution exposure. Evidence
    quality\nhigh."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2021 dose-response meta-analysis: RR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67-0.88) for highest
    vs lowest cycling. 9% reduction per 5 MET-h/week increase.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33774807/). UK Census cohort: HR 0.80
    for all-cause, HR 0.76 for CVD mortality in bike commuters.
    (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30079-6/fulltext).
    Associative evidence; highly consistent.
  mean: 0.78
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Cardiorespiratory fitness gain associated with biological age reduction.
    Low-impact preserves joint health. Regular cyclists show slower functional
    decline. No epigenetic clock studies specific to cycling. Strong
    biological plausibility.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Outdoor cycling associated with improved mood and stress reduction.
    Active commuting associated with better mental health outcomes. May
    enhance social connections. Moderate positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Among the best-studied exercises for mortality reduction. Meta-analysis
  of\ncohorts: 23% lower all-cause mortality, 24% lower CVD mortality with regular\n\
  cycling."
