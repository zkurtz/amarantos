summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 prospective cohort studies including 3,512,828 subjects examining dietary fiber intake and mortality. Found 23% reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.77), 26% reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.74), and 22% reduced cancer mortality (HR 0.78) with higher fiber consumption. Insoluble fiber was more effective than soluble fiber.'
