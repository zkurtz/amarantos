summary: "Gut microbiome metabolite of daidzein (soy isoflavone) with greater estrogenic\n\
  and antioxidant activity than parent compound. Only 25-30% of Western adults\nare
  \"equol producers.\" Improves arterial stiffness (11-12% CVD risk reduction\nif
  sustained)."

  description: "Recommended: via soy isoflavones, 25-50mg/day. Gut microbiome metabolite
    of daidzein (soy isoflavone) with greater estrogenic\nand antioxidant activity
    than parent compound. Only 25-30% of Western adults\nare \"equol producers.\"\
    \ Improves arterial stiffness (11-12% CVD risk reduction\nif sustained). Benefits
    limited to equol producers. Evidence quality low-moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.97
  std: 0.08
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 23 cohorts (n=330,826): isoflavone intake inversely
    associated with all-cause mortality but NOT CVD mortality specifically.
    RCT shows improved cfPWV in equol producers, equivalent to 11-12% CVD
    risk reduction if sustained. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26843154/).
    Benefit limited to ~30% who are equol producers. Speculative estimate.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.6
  evidence: |
    Estrogenic effects may protect against age-related decline in women.
    Antioxidant properties. No epigenetic clock studies. Limited human
    longevity data. Speculative.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    May reduce menopausal symptoms in equol-producing women. Limited mood
    data. Effect depends on producer status. Uncertain.
