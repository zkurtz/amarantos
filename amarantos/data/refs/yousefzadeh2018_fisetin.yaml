hard_claims:
- summary: Late-life fisetin administration extended median and maximum lifespan in
    wild-type mice
  choice: fisetin
  evidence_type: Mechanistic/first-principles
  effects: []
  population: wild-type mice
  notes: Fisetin identified as most potent senolytic among 10 flavonoids tested; hit-and-run
    mechanism allows intermittent dosing
soft_claims:
- summary: Fisetin is a potent senolytic that reduces senescence markers across multiple
    tissues and may translate to humans
  choice: fisetin
  source_type: expert opinion
  notes: Results confirmed in human adipose tissue explants; late-life intervention
    was sufficient to yield potent health benefit

summary: Preclinical study identifying fisetin as the most potent senolytic among
  10 flavonoids tested. Demonstrated that fisetin selectively eliminates senescent
  cells via a hit-and-run mechanism, reduces senescence markers across multiple tissues
  in aged mice, and extends median and maximum lifespan when administered late in
  life. Results validated in human adipose tissue explants.
