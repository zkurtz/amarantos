hard_claims:
- summary: Intermittent fisetin supplementation reduced age-related frailty by approximately
    15% in old mice
  choice: fisetin
  evidence_type: Mechanistic/first-principles
  effects:
  - outcome: frailty reduction
    mean: 0.85
    std: 0.2125
  population: aged mice (27 months old, male and female C57BL6/N)
  notes: Animal study; 100mg/kg/day fisetin; intermittent dosing (1 week on - 2 weeks
    off - 1 week on); no effects in young mice
- summary: Intermittent fisetin supplementation diminished age-related grip strength
    decline by approximately 30% in old mice
  choice: fisetin
  evidence_type: Mechanistic/first-principles
  effects:
  - outcome: grip strength preservation
    mean: 0.7
    std: 0.175
  population: aged mice (27 months old)
  notes: Comparable efficacy to genetic clearance of p16+ senescent cells and synthetic
    senolytic ABT-263
soft_claims:
- summary: Fisetin treatment ameliorated age-associated shifts in skeletal muscle
    transcriptome and reduced cellular senescence markers including p21 (Cdkn1a)
  choice: fisetin
  source_type: research article
  notes: Mechanism involves reduction of cellular senescence and p53 signaling pathways;
    suggests viable therapeutic approach for age-related physical function decline

summary: Animal study in aged mice (27 months) examining intermittent oral fisetin
  supplementation (100mg/kg/day) on physical function and cellular senescence. Found
  fisetin reduced age-related frailty by ~15% and grip strength decline by ~30%, comparable
  to genetic senescent cell clearance. Effects mediated through reduced p21 expression
  and cellular senescence in skeletal muscle.
