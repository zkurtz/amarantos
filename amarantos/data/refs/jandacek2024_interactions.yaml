- summary: Rapid weight loss mobilizes lipophilic toxins stored in adipose tissue
    to the bloodstream, potentially exposing vital organs
  choice: weight_loss

  notes: Discusses how adipose tissue safely stores environmental toxins (DDT, PCBs,
    perfluorinated compounds) that may be released during rapid weight loss with GLP-1
    agonists
- summary: Olestra, orlistat, or cholestyramine may help bind and excrete mobilized
    toxins during weight loss

  notes: Authors recommend monitoring circulating toxin concentrations in weight-loss
    patients before and after treatment

summary: Commentary discussing how adipose tissue stores lipophilic environmental
  toxins (DDT, PCBs, perfluorinated compounds). Rapid weight loss, including from
  potent GLP-1 agonists, mobilizes these toxins into the bloodstream where they can
  reach vital organs like brain and lungs. Proposes olestra, orlistat, or cholestyramine
  as potential interventions to bind and excrete mobilized toxins.
