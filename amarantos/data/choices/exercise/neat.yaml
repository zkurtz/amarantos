  description: "Recommended: standing, fidgeting, daily movement. Non-exercise activity
    thermogenesis: energy from daily activities excluding\nformal exercise. Standing
    increases expenditure 10-20% above sitting; walking\n100-200%. NEAT ranges from
    15% to 50% of total daily expenditure. Sedentary\nbehavior independently associated
    with CVD mortality even with exercise.\nStanding/walking improves insulin sensitivity
    better than equivalent cycling.\nEvidence quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Canadian cohort: dose-response between sitting time and all-cause/CVD
    mortality independent of exercise. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6058072/).
    Standing/walking of longer duration improves insulin action and lipids
    more than equivalent-energy cycling.
    (https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00562.2003).
    Reducing sedentary time associated with reduced metabolic syndrome, CVD
    events, and mortality. Associative evidence.
  mean: 0.82
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Prolonged sitting associated with accelerated biological aging. Breaking
    up sitting time improves metabolic markers. May support joint mobility
    and reduce sarcopenia risk. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Standing desks associated with improved energy and reduced back pain.
    Regular movement breaks improve alertness. Small positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Non-exercise activity thermogenesis: energy from daily activities excluding\n\
  formal exercise. Standing increases expenditure 10-20% above sitting; walking\n\
  100-200%."
