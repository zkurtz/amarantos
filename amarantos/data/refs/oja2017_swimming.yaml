summary: 'Pooled cohort study of 80,306 British adults (54% women, mean age 52) examining sport participation and mortality. Swimming showed 28% reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.72) and 41% reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.59) compared to non-swimmers. Among six sport types examined, swimming ranked among the most protective activities.'
