summary: 'Q-SYMBIO trial: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of CoQ10
  supplementation in 420 chronic heart failure patients over 2 years. Long-term CoQ10
  (300mg/day) reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 50%, all-cause mortality
  by 44%, cardiovascular mortality by 43%, and hospital admissions. Safe and well-tolerated.'
