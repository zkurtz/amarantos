domain: mind
name: Meditation Practice (20+ min/day)
summary: |
  Regular meditation includes mindfulness, transcendental, and focused attention
  practices. Meta-analyses show reduced anxiety, depression, and stress. May
  lower blood pressure (3-5 mmHg). Limited direct mortality data. Improves
  emotional regulation and attention. Effects comparable to first-line
  treatments for anxiety. Evidence quality moderate from RCTs.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No large mortality RCTs. TM practitioners showed reduced CVD mortality
      in small trial (n=201). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23149426/).
      Meta-analysis: meditation reduces BP by 3-5 mmHg, comparable to lifestyle
      interventions. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28384004/). Effect on
      mortality extrapolated from CVD risk factor improvements. Speculative.
    mean: 0.95
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Small studies suggest meditation may slow epigenetic aging and preserve
      telomere length. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23092711/). Reduces
      chronic stress and inflammation markers. Limited and mixed evidence.
      Plausible but speculative.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 47 RCTs (n=3,515): moderate effect on anxiety (d=0.38),
      depression (d=0.30), and stress (d=0.33). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24395196/).
      Effects comparable to CBT for anxiety. Improves emotional regulation
      and life satisfaction. Moderate-large positive effect.
    mean: 0.6
    std: 0.3
