domain: thermal
name: Finnish Sauna (4-7x/week, 15-20min)
summary: |
  Best-studied heat therapy with strong mortality data. Finnish cohort (n=2,315):
  4-7x/week sauna associated with 40% lower all-cause mortality, 50% lower CVD
  mortality, 63% lower sudden cardiac death vs 1x/week. Effects persist after
  adjustment for exercise and risk factors. Improves endothelial function, lowers
  BP. Evidence quality high from large prospective cohorts.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Kuopio cohort (n=2,315, 20.7y follow-up): 4-7x/week vs 1x/week: HR 0.60
      for all-cause mortality, HR 0.50 for CVD mortality, HR 0.37 for sudden
      cardiac death. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705824/). Extended
      cohort including women (n=1,688): linear decrease in CVD mortality with
      frequency. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6262976/).
      Associative evidence; highly consistent.
    mean: 0.65
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Heat shock proteins induced by sauna may protect against protein
      aggregation. Improves vascular function and reduces inflammation.
      Associated with lower dementia risk. No epigenetic clock studies.
      Strong biological plausibility.
    mean: 1.5
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Sauna associated with improved mood and relaxation. May improve sleep
      quality. Social component in traditional Finnish culture. Moderate
      positive effect likely.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
