- summary: Curcumin supplementation significantly reduces fasting blood sugar
  choice: curcumin_turmeric
  evidence_type: Meta-analysis
  effects: []
  population: general adult population
  sample_size: 7216
  notes: High credibility evidence from 103 RCTs; also significantly reduces C-reactive
    protein, improves HDL, and reduces weight

  notes: High credibility evidence for CRP reduction; 55% of 42 outcomes showed statistically
    significant effects
- summary: Curcumin supplementation improves lipid profiles (HDL cholesterol)
  choice: curcumin_turmeric
  evidence_type: Meta-analysis
  effects: []

summary: Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 103 randomized controlled
  trials involving 7,216 participants examining curcumin effects across 42 health
  outcomes. Found high credibility evidence for benefits on fasting blood sugar, CRP,
  HDL cholesterol, and weight. Approximately 55% of outcomes showed statistically
  significant effects. Authors note need for larger, longer-term RCTs.
