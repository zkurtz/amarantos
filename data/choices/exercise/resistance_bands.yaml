domain: exercise
name: Resistance Bands (2-3x/week)
summary: |
  Elastic resistance training provides similar strength gains to free weights at
  lower cost and joint stress. Meta-analyses show improved muscle strength and
  reduced functional decline in older adults. Accessible for home use and
  rehabilitation. Comparable benefits to traditional resistance training for
  muscle mass and metabolic health. Evidence quality moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No direct mortality studies for resistance bands specifically. Meta-
      analyses of resistance training show 21-27% lower all-cause mortality.
      Elastic resistance produces similar strength gains to traditional
      resistance. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125562/). Extrapolated
      from resistance training literature.
    mean: 0.83
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Resistance training prevents sarcopenia and functional decline. Elastic
      resistance effective for muscle strength in older adults. Preserves
      mobility and independence. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 0.8
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Strength training associated with improved self-efficacy and functional
      capacity. Accessible format may improve adherence. Joint-friendly.
      Small positive effect plausible.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
