summary: "Meta-analysis of 12 studies with 111,309 participants examining dose-response relationship between objectively measured daily step counts and mortality/cardiovascular events. Found significant risk reductions starting at approximately 2,500 steps/day, with optimal doses at 8,763 steps/day for all-cause mortality (HR 0.40) and 7,126 steps/day for CVD (HR 0.49). Plateau effect observed above 10,000 steps/day."
