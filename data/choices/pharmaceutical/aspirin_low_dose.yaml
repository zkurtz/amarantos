domain: pharmaceutical
name: Low-Dose Aspirin (81-100mg daily)
summary: |
  Once standard primary prevention, now more nuanced. ASPREE trial (n=19,114,
  age 70+): no CVD benefit, increased bleeding. Benefits clearer for secondary
  prevention. May reduce colorectal cancer (NNT ~200 over 10-20 years).
  CAUTION: bleeding risk increases with age. Guidelines now recommend against
  routine primary prevention in elderly. Evidence quality high.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      ASPREE trial (n=19,114, age≥70, healthy): HR 1.14 for all-cause
      mortality with aspirin. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30221596/).
      Meta-analysis for primary prevention: no mortality benefit (HR 0.94,
      CI: 0.88-1.01), significant bleeding increase.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676625/). May reduce CRC mortality
      long-term. Complex risk-benefit; population-dependent.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No direct aging benefits. Anti-inflammatory effects theoretically
      relevant. ASPREE showed possible cognitive harm in elderly. Not
      recommended for aging prevention. Centered at null.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.3
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Generally well-tolerated. GI discomfort in some. Increased bruising.
      Peace of mind for some users; anxiety about bleeding for others.
      Essentially neutral for wellbeing.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.2
