domain: diet
name: Almonds (1 oz/28g daily)
summary: |
  Regular almond/nut consumption associated with ~20% lower all-cause mortality
  and cardiovascular disease. Rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, vitamin E.
  Strong observational evidence from large cohorts. Part of Mediterranean diet
  pattern shown to reduce CVD events in PREDIMED trial.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 20 prospective cohorts, n=467,389. High vs low nut intake:
      RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85) for all-cause mortality. Per 28g/day: RR 0.78
      (95% CI: 0.72-0.84). Associative evidence. Aune 2016
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27916000/). Mayhew 2016

    mean: 0.81
    std: 0.02
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No direct epigenetic clock studies for almonds. Extrapolated from mortality
      reduction: ~19% lower mortality roughly corresponds to 2 years. Nuts contain
      polyphenols with potential senolytic activity. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 1.5
    std: 1.0
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Limited direct evidence on mood. Some studies show nuts reduce inflammation
      markers linked to depression. No RCTs specifically on almonds and mood.
      Speculative estimate centered near zero.
    mean: 0.1
    std: 0.3
