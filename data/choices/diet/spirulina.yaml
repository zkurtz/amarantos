  description: "Recommended: 1-8g/day. Blue-green algae with strong meta-analysis
    support for cardiometabolic benefits.\n2025 meta-analysis of 35 RCTs: reduces
    TG (-15mg/dL), TC (-12mg/dL), LDL (-8mg/dL),\nSBP (-4mmHg), DBP (-3mmHg), weight
    (-1.8kg). A 2mmHg DBP reduction associated\nwith 17% lower hypertension prevalence.
    Rich in protein and phycocyanin. No\nmortality RCTs. Evidence quality moderate-high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. 2025 meta-analysis of 35 RCTs shows improved glucose,
    lipids, BP, weight, and inflammation.
    (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229925001189).
    2mmHg DBP reduction associated with 6% lower CHD risk and 15% lower stroke
    risk. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12245695/). Extrapolated
    estimate.
  mean: 0.94
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Rich in antioxidants (phycocyanin) with anti-inflammatory effects. May
    support cellular health. No epigenetic clock studies. Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May improve energy via high protein and B12 content. Some report
    improved vitality. Limited direct mood data. Small positive effect
    plausible.

  std: 0.3

  2025 meta-analysis of 35 RCTs: reduces TG (-15mg/dL), TC (-12mg/dL), LDL (-8mg/dL),\n\
  SBP (-4mmHg), DBP (-3mmHg), weight (-1.8kg)."
