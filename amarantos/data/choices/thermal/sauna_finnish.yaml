  description: "Recommended: 4-7x/week, 15-20min. Best-studied heat therapy with strong
    mortality data. Finnish cohort (n=2,315):\n4-7x/week sauna associated with 40%
    lower all-cause mortality, 50% lower CVD\nmortality, 63% lower sudden cardiac
    death vs 1x/week. Effects persist after\nadjustment for exercise and risk factors.
    Improves endothelial function, lowers\nBP. Evidence quality high from large prospective
    cohorts."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Kuopio cohort (n=2,315, 20.7y follow-up): 4-7x/week vs 1x/week: HR 0.60
    for all-cause mortality, HR 0.50 for CVD mortality, HR 0.37 for sudden
    cardiac death. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705824/). Extended
    cohort including women (n=1,688): linear decrease in CVD mortality with
    frequency. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6262976/).
    Associative evidence; highly consistent.
  mean: 0.65
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Heat shock proteins induced by sauna may protect against protein
    aggregation. Improves vascular function and reduces inflammation.
    Associated with lower dementia risk. No epigenetic clock studies.
    Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Sauna associated with improved mood and relaxation. May improve sleep
    quality. Social component in traditional Finnish culture. Moderate
    positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Best-studied heat therapy with strong mortality data. Finnish cohort (n=2,315):\n\
  4-7x/week sauna associated with 40% lower all-cause mortality, 50% lower CVD\nmortality,
  63% lower sudden cardiac death vs 1x/week."
