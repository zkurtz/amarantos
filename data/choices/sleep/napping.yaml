domain: sleep
name: Strategic Napping (<30min, early afternoon)
summary: |
  Napping shows complex dose-response. Meta-analysis: naps >60min associated
  with 30% higher mortality, likely marker of poor nocturnal sleep or illness.
  Short naps (<30min) may be neutral or slightly beneficial. Afternoon timing
  aligns with circadian dip. Benefits may depend on context (siesta cultures,
  sleep debt). Evidence quality low-moderate; confounding concerns.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis (n=313,651): napping >60min HR 1.30 (95% CI: 1.10-1.54)
      for all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32741032/).
      Short naps (<30min) showed no significant mortality association.
      Long naps may indicate underlying health issues or poor nocturnal
      sleep. Associative evidence with significant confounding concerns.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Brief naps may support memory consolidation and cognitive function.
      No direct aging data. Long naps associated with cognitive decline
      in observational studies (possibly reverse causation). Uncertain.
    mean: 0.1
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Short naps improve alertness and performance in experimental studies.
      May reduce afternoon fatigue. Benefits depend on individual sleep
      need and nocturnal sleep quality. Small positive effect for
      short naps in sleep-deprived individuals.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
