  description: "Recommended: daily, ≥10¹⁰ CFU. Live microorganisms that modulate gut
    microbiome. Meta-analyses show reduced\nbody weight, BMI, waist circumference,
    and improved lipid profiles in\noverweight/obese. May lower BP, glucose, and inflammatory
    markers (TNF-α). No\ndirect mortality RCTs. Benefits most pronounced in those
    with elevated baseline\ncardiometabolic risk. Strain-specific effects. Evidence
    quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 26 RCTs (n=1,720) in overweight/obese:
    reduced weight (-0.7kg), BMI, waist circumference, TNF-α, insulin, TC, LDL.
    (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561421003198).
    Effects require ≥10¹⁰ CFU for ≥8 weeks. Theoretical CVD benefit via risk
    factor improvement; extrapolated estimate.
  mean: 0.96
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Gut microbiome composition changes with aging. Probiotics may improve
    microbial diversity and reduce inflammation. No epigenetic clock studies.
    Speculative.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Gut-brain axis research suggests microbiome affects mood. Some strains
    (psychobiotics) show anxiolytic effects in RCTs. Limited but growing
    evidence. Small positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Live microorganisms that modulate gut microbiome. Meta-analyses show reduced\n\
  body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and improved lipid profiles in\noverweight/obese."
