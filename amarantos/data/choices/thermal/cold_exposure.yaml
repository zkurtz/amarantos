  description: "Recommended: cold showers, ice baths. Deliberate cold exposure via
    showers (30sec-3min) or immersion (10-15°C).\n2025 meta-analysis: may reduce stress
    and improve sleep quality with limited\nevidence; little support for mood or immunity
    claims. Enhances parasympathetic\nactivity. May reduce adipose tissue and improve
    insulin sensitivity. CAUTION:\ncontraindicated in CVD. Evidence quality low; mostly
    small studies."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. 2025 PLOS One meta-analysis (11 studies, n=3,177):
    limited evidence for health benefits. (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615).
    May reduce insulin resistance and body fat. CAUTION: contraindicated
    in cardiovascular disease. (https://www.heart.org/en/news/2022/12/09/youre-not-a-polar-bear-the-plunge-into-cold-water-comes-with-risks).
    Centered at null with uncertainty.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Cold exposure activates brown adipose tissue and may improve metabolic
    health. Hormetic stress may enhance resilience. Limited human longevity
    data. Speculative.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Anecdotal reports of improved alertness and mood. Meta-analysis found
    little evidence for mood benefits. May improve stress tolerance.
    Effects variable between individuals. Small effect uncertain.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.4
summary: "Deliberate cold exposure via showers (30sec-3min) or immersion (10-15°C).
  2025 meta-analysis: may reduce stress and improve sleep quality with limited\nevidence;
  little support for mood or immunity claims."
