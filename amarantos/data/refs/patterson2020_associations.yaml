summary: 'Prospective cohort study of over 300,000 commuters in England and Wales using linked Census data over 25 years (1991-2011). Cycling to work associated with 20% reduced all-cause mortality, 24% reduced cardiovascular mortality, and 16% reduced cancer mortality compared to driving. Walking showed weaker associations. Rail commuters also showed benefits, likely due to active travel to transit.'
