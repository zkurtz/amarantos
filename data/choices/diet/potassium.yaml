  description: "Recommended: 3500-4700mg/day from food. Essential mineral; most adults
    under-consume. Meta-analysis: reduces SBP by\n3.5mmHg, DBP by 2mmHg; greater effect
    in hypertensives (-7mmHg SBP). 24%\nlower stroke risk with higher intake. U-shaped
    relationship suggests optimal\nrange; excessive intake may increase BP. WHO recommends
    ≥3.5g/day. Dietary\nsources preferred. Evidence quality high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Systematic review and meta-analysis: higher potassium intake associated
    with 24% lower stroke risk (RR 0.76). CVD risk reduction NS in some
    analyses. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23558164/). Salt substitute
    trial showed reduced CV mortality with potassium-enriched salt. U-shaped
    dose-response suggests optimal intake range.
    (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.015719). Dietary
    sources preferred.

- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Supports vascular function and may protect against cognitive decline
    via BP reduction. No epigenetic clock studies. Associated with healthy
    dietary patterns. Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Deficiency causes fatigue and muscle weakness. Adequate intake supports
    muscle function and energy. Limited direct mood data.

summary: "Essential mineral; most adults under-consume. Meta-analysis: reduces SBP
  by\n3.5mmHg, DBP by 2mmHg; greater effect in hypertensives (-7mmHg SBP)."
