summary: Cross-sectional analysis of 10,905 NHANES participants (1999-2016) examining
  pet ownership and cardiovascular health. Found pet ownership (cat or dog) independently
  associated with lower systemic hypertension prevalence (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.89).
  Pet owners had higher hemoglobin, lower LDL cholesterol, and lower prevalence of
  diabetes and stroke, though these were not significant after multivariate adjustment.
  Authors note further longitudinal studies needed.
