summary: Randomized controlled clinical trial in healthy older adults examining the
  efficacy of glycine and N-acetylcysteine (GlyNAC) supplementation on glutathione
  redox status and oxidative damage. Found that GlyNAC supplementation improved glutathione
  levels and reduced markers of oxidative stress.
