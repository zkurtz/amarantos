summary: Corrigendum to original 2022 study on brusatol, a natural compound that inhibits
  pancreatic cancer cell invasion and migration by suppressing the NRF2/NF-kB/STAT3
  signaling cascade. The original research demonstrated brusatol may enhance chemotherapy
  efficacy by targeting the Nrf2 pathway in pancreatic cancer cells.
