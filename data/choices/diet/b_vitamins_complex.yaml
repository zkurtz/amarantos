domain: diet
name: B-Vitamins Complex (B6, B12, Folate)
summary: |
  Despite lowering homocysteine (a CVD risk marker), RCTs show NO reduction in
  cardiovascular events or mortality. Meta-analysis of 24 RCTs (n=57,952) found
  null effect on MACE, MI, stroke, or death. May benefit stroke prevention
  marginally. Deficiency should be corrected but supplementation in replete
  individuals appears ineffective for CVD prevention.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 24 RCTs, n=57,952. B vitamins vs placebo: RR 1.01
      (95% CI: 0.97-1.05) for total mortality. No benefit for MACE, MI, or
      cardiac death. Causal evidence from RCTs. Huang 2014
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4169527/). HOPE-2 trial
      (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa060900).
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.02
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No evidence that B vitamin supplementation slows aging in replete
      individuals. Deficiency accelerates cognitive decline. No epigenetic
      clock data for supplementation.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      B12 deficiency causes fatigue and neurological symptoms. Supplementation
      in deficient individuals improves symptoms. No benefit shown for mood in
      replete individuals in RCTs.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.2
