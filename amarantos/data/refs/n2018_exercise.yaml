- summary: NEAT represents the main variable component of daily total energy expenditure;
    obese individuals could expend approximately 350 additional calories daily by
    adopting activity patterns of lean counterparts
  choice: moderate_cardio
  source_type: review
  notes: Non-exercise activity thermogenesis includes fidgeting, posture changes,
    household tasks; energy expenditure from NEAT larger than exercise-related thermogenesis
    when measured over the day
- summary: Low NEAT levels associated with increased risks for metabolic syndrome,
    type 2 diabetes, poor glucose management, and cardiovascular disease
  choice: moderate_cardio
  source_type: review
  notes: Exercise alone cannot counteract prolonged sitting; maintaining regular movement
    throughout the day provides independent metabolic benefits; NEAT offers practical
    approach to obesity management

summary: Review of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) as a component of total
  daily energy expenditure. NEAT encompasses unplanned daily activities like fidgeting
  and household tasks, representing the main variable component of energy expenditure.
  Low NEAT associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
  Obese individuals could burn ~350 extra calories daily by matching lean counterparts'
  activity patterns.
