summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (1,606 participants) and 11 cohort studies (127,038 participants) examining increased potassium intake effects on cardiovascular risk. Found 24% reduced stroke risk (RR 0.76) and 3.49 mm Hg systolic blood pressure reduction in hypertensive adults. No significant adverse effects on renal function observed.'
