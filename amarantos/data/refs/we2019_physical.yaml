summary: 'Systematic umbrella review examining relationships between physical activity and mortality outcomes. Included 13 reviews on all-cause mortality, 6 on CVD mortality, and 10 on incident CVD, encompassing studies with up to 3.9 million participants. Found consistent inverse dose-response relationships with no evidence of harm at extreme volumes up to 4-10 times guideline recommendations.'
