summary: Methodological study examining how mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies affect
  skeletal muscle metabolism in patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia
  and Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Used saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers with high-resolution
  respirometry to demonstrate that enzyme activity ratios decrease linearly with increasing
  mtDNA heteroplasmy, revealing metabolic threshold effects.
