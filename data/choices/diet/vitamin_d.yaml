domain: diet
name: Vitamin D (1000-4000 IU/day to sufficiency)
summary: |
  Essential hormone-like vitamin; deficiency common. Meta-analysis of RCTs:
  daily supplementation reduces cancer mortality by 12% (not incidence). All-cause
  mortality reduced 6% with >5 years follow-up. No effect on CVD mortality.
  Daily dosing more effective than intermittent bolus. Target serum 30-50ng/mL.
  Evidence quality moderate for cancer mortality; high for bone health.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of RCTs: cancer mortality RR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.96) with
      daily dosing. (https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/s0923-7534(19)31159-7/fulltext).
      All-cause mortality RR 0.94 with >3 years follow-up.
      (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/413032).
      CVD mortality NS. Benefit requires daily dosing, sufficient duration.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.04
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Vitamin D receptors throughout body. Deficiency associated with frailty
      and cognitive decline. May support muscle function. No epigenetic clock
      studies specific to supplementation. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Deficiency associated with depression. Meta-analyses show modest benefits
      for mood in deficient individuals. No clear benefit in replete individuals.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
