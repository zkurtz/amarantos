  description: "Recommended: 1 oz/28g daily. Regular almond/nut consumption associated
    with ~20% lower all-cause mortality\nand cardiovascular disease. Rich in monounsaturated
    fats, fiber, vitamin E.\nStrong observational evidence from large cohorts. Part
    of Mediterranean diet\npattern shown to reduce CVD events in PREDIMED trial."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 20 prospective cohorts, n=467,389. High vs low nut intake:
    RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85) for all-cause mortality. Per 28g/day: RR 0.78
    (95% CI: 0.72-0.84). Associative evidence. Aune 2016
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27916000/). Mayhew 2016
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26548503/).
  mean: 0.81
  std: 0.02
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No direct epigenetic clock studies for almonds. Extrapolated from mortality
    reduction: ~19% lower mortality roughly corresponds to 2 years. Nuts contain
    polyphenols with potential senolytic activity. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 1.0
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Limited direct evidence on mood. Some studies show nuts reduce inflammation
    markers linked to depression. No RCTs specifically on almonds and mood.
    Speculative estimate centered near zero.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Regular almond/nut consumption associated with ~20% lower all-cause mortality\n\
  and cardiovascular disease. Rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, vitamin E."
