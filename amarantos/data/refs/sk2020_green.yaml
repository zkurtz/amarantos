summary: Review of epidemiological evidence from 82 meta-analyses on green tea consumption
  and health outcomes. Found inverse associations between green tea intake and cardiovascular
  disease mortality (RR 0.72), stroke incidence (17-36% reduction), and several cancers.
  Mixed results for diabetes prevention. Study population includes general adults
  from observational studies.
