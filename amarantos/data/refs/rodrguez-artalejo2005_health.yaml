summary: "Prospective cohort study of 394 heart failure patients at 4 Spanish hospitals examining health-related quality of life as a predictor of hospital readmission and mortality. During 6-month median follow-up, 35% had emergency rehospitalization and 17.8% died. Worse HRQL scores on SF-36 physical functioning, general health, and mental health subscales were associated with higher readmission and mortality rates."
