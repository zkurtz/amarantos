summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 longitudinal cohort studies examining
  green space exposure and all-cause mortality in over 8.3 million individuals from
  7 countries. Found a statistically significant inverse association between residential
  greenness (measured by NDVI within 500m buffer) and mortality risk (HR 0.96 per
  0.1 NDVI increment, 95% CI 0.94-0.97).
