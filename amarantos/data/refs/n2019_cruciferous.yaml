summary: Prospective cohort study of 88,184 Japanese adults aged 45-74 followed for
  median 16.9 years examining cruciferous vegetable intake and mortality. Found that
  higher cruciferous vegetable consumption was associated with 14% reduced all-cause
  mortality in men (HR 0.86) and 11% reduced mortality in women (HR 0.89). Cruciferous
  vegetables contain isothiocyanates which reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.
