summary: Prospective population-based cohort study of 829 participants aged 45-84
  followed for 20 years with 341 deaths. Higher dietary spermidine intake strongly
  associated with lower mortality (HR 0.76 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.67-0.86). The
  mortality difference between highest and lowest thirds was equivalent to being 5.7
  years younger. Results independently validated in the SAPHIR study.
