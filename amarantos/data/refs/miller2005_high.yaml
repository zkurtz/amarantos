summary: "Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (135,967 participants) examining dose-response relationship between vitamin E supplementation and all-cause mortality. Found high-dosage vitamin E (400 IU/day or more) may increase mortality risk. Trials involved adults with chronic diseases; findings may not apply to healthy adults. Benefits or harms of lower doses were unclear."
