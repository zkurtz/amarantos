summary: Prospective cohort study using NHANES 2003-2014 data (30,378 participants,
  2,855 deaths) combined with meta-analysis of 5 cohort studies (601,893 individuals).
  Found non-significant inverse association in NHANES but significant 6% lower mortality
  risk in pooled meta-analysis. Mushrooms are rich sources of antioxidants ergothioneine
  and glutathione, plus vitamins and minerals like selenium and copper.
