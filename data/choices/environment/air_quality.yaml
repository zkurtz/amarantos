  description: "Recommended: HEPA filtration, low-pollution living. Within first-world
    variation range: indoor air filtration, choosing lower\npollution neighborhoods,
    avoiding high-traffic areas. PM2.5 strongly\nassociated with mortality even at
    levels below WHO guidelines. HEPA filters\nreduce indoor particles by 50-70%.
    Moving from moderate to low pollution\nareas shows measurable benefit. Evidence
    quality high for air pollution\neffects; moderate for intervention effectiveness."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis: 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5 associated with 6-8% higher
    mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260911/). Effects persist
    below WHO guidelines. Within first-world range (5-25 μg/m³), moving
    from high to low exposure meaningful. HEPA filter RCTs show reduced
    BP and inflammation markers. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26178426/).
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Air pollution associated with accelerated epigenetic aging and
    shorter telomeres. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26133619/).
    PM2.5 exposure linked to cognitive decline. Reducing exposure
    may slow these processes. Moderate evidence.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.4
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Air pollution associated with reduced cognitive performance and
    increased depression symptoms. Cleaner air improves respiratory
    comfort. HEPA filters reduce allergy symptoms. Small positive
    effect within first-world variation range.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.2
summary: "Within first-world variation range: indoor air filtration, choosing lower\n\
  pollution neighborhoods, avoiding high-traffic areas. PM2.5 strongly\nassociated
  with mortality even at levels below WHO guidelines."
