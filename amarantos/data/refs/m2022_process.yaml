- summary: Study identifies carbon turnover processes as explaining ~70% of model
    spread in vegetation and soil carbon changes, with rising CO2 and nitrogen deposition
    increasing carbon storage
  choice: none

  notes: This study is about climate science and land carbon sinks, not a health intervention.
    It does not relate to any longevity or health intervention choice.

summary: Environmental science study examining uncertainty in climate models regarding
  land carbon sink. Found that differences in carbon turnover explain approximately
  70% of model disagreement in vegetation and soil carbon changes. Not related to
  health or longevity interventions.
