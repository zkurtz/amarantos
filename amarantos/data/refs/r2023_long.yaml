summary: Randomized controlled trial (CALERIE) of 220 healthy adults randomized to
  25% caloric restriction or ad libitum eating for 2 years. Found caloric restriction
  slowed pace of biological aging as measured by DunedinPACE DNA methylation algorithm,
  though effects were small. No significant changes in PhenoAge or GrimAge biological
  age clocks.
