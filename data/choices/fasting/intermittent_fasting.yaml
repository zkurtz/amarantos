domain: fasting
name: Intermittent Fasting (5:2 or alternate day)
summary: |
  Periodic caloric restriction including 5:2 (2 days/week at 500-600 kcal) or
  alternate day fasting. Meta-analyses show similar weight loss to continuous
  restriction. May improve insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. Adherence
  variable. No mortality RCTs. Effects likely overlap with caloric restriction.
  Evidence quality moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis: similar metabolic improvements to
      continuous caloric restriction. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28459931/).
      Ramadan fasting observational studies show mixed results. Effect on
      mortality extrapolated from metabolic benefits. Speculative.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.10
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Periodic fasting activates autophagy, reduces IGF-1, and may promote
      cellular renewal. Animal models show lifespan benefits. Human aging
      data very limited. Mechanistically promising. Speculative.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      On fasting days: hunger, reduced energy, possible irritability.
      Non-fasting days: normal eating freedom. Some report improved
      relationship with food long-term. Adherence challenges for many.
      Mixed effect; individual variation high.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.4
