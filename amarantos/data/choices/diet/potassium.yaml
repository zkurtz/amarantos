  description: "Recommended: 3500-4700mg/day from food. Essential mineral; most adults
    under-consume. Meta-analysis: reduces SBP by\n3.5mmHg, DBP by 2mmHg; greater effect
    in hypertensives (-7mmHg SBP). 24%\nlower stroke risk with higher intake. U-shaped
    relationship suggests optimal\nrange; excessive intake may increase BP. WHO recommends
    ≥3.5g/day. Dietary\nsources preferred. Evidence quality high."

    Systematic review and meta-analysis: higher potassium intake associated
    with 24% lower stroke risk (RR 0.76). CVD risk reduction NS in some
    analyses. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23558164/). Salt substitute
    trial showed reduced CV mortality with potassium-enriched salt. U-shaped
    dose-response suggests optimal intake range.

    sources preferred.

    Supports vascular function and may protect against cognitive decline
    via BP reduction. No epigenetic clock studies. Associated with healthy
    dietary patterns. Speculative.

    Deficiency causes fatigue and muscle weakness. Adequate intake supports
    muscle function and energy. Limited direct mood data.
