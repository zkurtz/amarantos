domain: fasting
name: Prolonged Fasting (3-5 day water fast, periodic)
summary: |
  Extended fasting periods of 3-5 days, typically water-only, done periodically
  (1-4x/year). Profoundly activates autophagy and stem cell regeneration in
  animal models. Fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) RCTs show improved biomarkers.
  CAUTION: medical supervision recommended. Limited human longevity data.
  Evidence quality low; mostly mechanistic and FMD surrogate data.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs for prolonged fasting. FMD trial (n=100): improved
      CVD risk factors, reduced IGF-1, lower inflammation markers.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28202779/). CAUTION: risks include
      electrolyte imbalance, refeeding syndrome if not done properly.
      Speculative mortality benefit with notable risks.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.15
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Strongest autophagy activation of fasting interventions. Animal studies:
      periodic prolonged fasting extends lifespan. FMD reduces biological
      age markers in humans. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148523/).
      Promising but limited human data. High uncertainty.
    mean: 0.8
    std: 1.0
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Fasting period: significant hunger, fatigue, cognitive fog (days 1-2).
      Many report mental clarity days 3-5 (ketosis). Post-fast: improved
      relationship with food, appreciation for eating. Net effect variable.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.5
