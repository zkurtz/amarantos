summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 prospective cohort studies including
  3,512,828 subjects examining dietary fiber intake and mortality. Found 23% reduced
  all-cause mortality (HR 0.77), 26% reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.74), and
  22% reduced cancer mortality (HR 0.78) with higher fiber consumption. Insoluble
  fiber was more effective than soluble fiber.
