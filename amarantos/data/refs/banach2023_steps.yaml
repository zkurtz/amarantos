summary: Meta-analysis examining the relationship between daily step count and
  mortality outcomes. Found a dose-response relationship where more steps are
  associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with benefits
  starting at modest step counts and continuing up to around 8,000-10,000 steps/day.
