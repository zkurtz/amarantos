summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis examining betaine supplementation effects on cardiovascular markers. Betaine significantly increased plasma betaine concentration (+82.14 umol/L) and reduced homocysteine (-1.30 umol/L). However, doses >=4g/day increased total cholesterol (+14.12 mg/dl) and LDL (+10.26 mg/dl). Doses <=4g/day recommended for homocysteine-lowering benefits without adverse lipid effects. No significant effects on triglycerides, HDL, glucose, CRP, or blood pressure.'
