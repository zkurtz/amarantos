summary: 'Randomized controlled trial examining whether metformin inhibits mitochondrial adaptations to aerobic exercise training in older adults (average age 62). Found that metformin attenuated exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity, VO2 max, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. Both groups showed improvements in fat mass, HbA1c, and glucose variability independent of metformin. Results suggest caution regarding metformin as an anti-aging therapy, particularly when combined with exercise.'
