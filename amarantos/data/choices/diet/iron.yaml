  description: "Recommended: adequate, not excess. Essential mineral; both deficiency
    and excess harmful. In heart failure with\niron deficiency, IV iron reduces hospitalizations
    but not mortality. Excess\niron (ferritin >300) associated with increased CVD
    and cancer risk via\noxidative stress. Heme iron intake associated with 7% increased
    CVD risk per\n1mg/day. Optimal: maintain adequate without excess."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2025 Nature Medicine meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (n=7,175) in HF: IV iron
    reduced HF hospitalizations (RR 0.72) but not mortality (RR 0.90 NS).
    (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03671-1). Heme iron dose-
    response meta-analysis: RR 1.07 per 1mg/day for CVD.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439662/). Excess iron increases
    cancer risk. Centered at null; both deficiency and excess harmful.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Iron accumulation associated with accelerated aging in animal models.
    Excess iron causes oxidative damage. No benefit from supplementation
    in replete individuals. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Deficiency causes fatigue and cognitive impairment. Supplementation in
    deficient individuals improves energy. No benefit in replete individuals.
    Effect depends on baseline status.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
summary: "Essential mineral; both deficiency and excess harmful. In heart failure
  with\niron deficiency, IV iron reduces hospitalizations but not mortality."
