domain: exercise
name: Vigorous Cardio (75-150 min/week)
summary: |
  WHO alternative to moderate cardio: 75-150min vigorous activity. PURE study
  (n=130K): ~35% reduction in CV mortality. AHA cohort: 21-23% lower all-cause
  mortality at 2-4x guidelines. Running, rowing, fast cycling, competitive
  sports. Greater time efficiency than moderate cardio. No upper limit of harm
  observed. Evidence quality very high.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      AHA 30-year cohort: 150-300min/week vigorous activity: 21-23% lower
      all-cause mortality. (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162).
      PURE study (n=130K+): vigorous activity ~35% lower CV mortality.
      Greatest benefit from sedentary to any activity. Causal and associative
      evidence.
    mean: 0.68
    std: 0.05
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Vigorous exercise most efficiently improves VO2max, strongly linked to
      biological aging. May improve mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative
      stress. Associated with slower cognitive decline. Strong biological
      plausibility.
    mean: 2.0
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Vigorous exercise associated with greater endorphin release ("runner's
      high"). Improved self-efficacy and body image. May enhance sleep quality.
      Moderate positive effect likely.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
