summary: Meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials with 1,986 participants
  examining cocoa consumption effects on cardiometabolic risk markers. Found significant
  reductions in total cholesterol (-8.35 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (-9.47 mg/dL), fasting
  blood glucose (-4.91 mg/dL), systolic BP (-2.52 mmHg), and diastolic BP (-1.58 mmHg).
  No significant effects on body weight, BMI, triglycerides, HDL, or HbA1c. Studies
  used cocoa extract or >=70% dark chocolate for >=4 weeks.
