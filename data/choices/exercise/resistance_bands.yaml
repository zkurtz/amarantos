  description: "Recommended: 2-3x/week. Elastic resistance training provides similar
    strength gains to free weights at\nlower cost and joint stress. Meta-analyses
    show improved muscle strength and\nreduced functional decline in older adults.
    Accessible for home use and\nrehabilitation. Comparable benefits to traditional
    resistance training for\nmuscle mass and metabolic health. Evidence quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No direct mortality studies for resistance bands specifically. Meta-
    analyses of resistance training show 21-27% lower all-cause mortality.
    Elastic resistance produces similar strength gains to traditional
    resistance. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125562/). Extrapolated
    from resistance training literature.
  mean: 0.83
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Resistance training prevents sarcopenia and functional decline. Elastic
    resistance effective for muscle strength in older adults. Preserves
    mobility and independence. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Strength training associated with improved self-efficacy and functional
    capacity. Accessible format may improve adherence. Joint-friendly.
    Small positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Elastic resistance training provides similar strength gains to free weights
  at\nlower cost and joint stress. Meta-analyses show improved muscle strength and\n\
  reduced functional decline in older adults."
