summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 RCTs (176,253 participants) examining omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes. Found significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality (6%), CHD events (10%), and MI (11%), but no significant effect on all-cause mortality. EPA monotherapy showed stronger effects than combined EPA/DHA."
