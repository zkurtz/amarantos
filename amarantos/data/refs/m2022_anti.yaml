summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 RCTs examining resveratrol supplementation
  effects on inflammatory markers in cardiovascular disease patients. Found significant
  reductions in CRP (mean difference = -0.63, p = 0.01) and TNF-alpha (mean difference
  = -0.55, p = 0.02). No significant effect on IL-6 levels.
