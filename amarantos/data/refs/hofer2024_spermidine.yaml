summary: Mechanistic study demonstrating that spermidine is essential for fasting-mediated
  autophagy and longevity across multiple species. Found that spermidine levels increase
  during fasting in yeast, flies, mice, and humans. Genetic or pharmacological blockade
  of spermidine synthesis eliminated the lifespan-extending, cardioprotective, and
  anti-arthritic effects of fasting. Mechanism operates through eIF5A hypusination.
