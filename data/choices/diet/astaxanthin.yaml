  description: "Recommended: 4-12mg/day. Potent carotenoid antioxidant from algae/seafood.
    Modest benefits for lipid\nprofile (LDL reduction) and blood pressure. No mortality
    trials. Promising\npilot data in heart failure (improved ejection fraction). Better
    safety\nprofile than vitamin E. Evidence is preliminary; mostly small trials."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 17 studies (n=1101) shows improved
    lipid profile. Fassett 2017 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27924978/).
    Theoretical CVD benefit via lipids/inflammation but unproven for hard
    endpoints. Unlike vitamin E, no signal of harm. Centered at null.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.1
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Strong antioxidant in vitro. Animal studies show benefits. Human aging
    studies absent. Reduces oxidative stress markers. No epigenetic clock
    data. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Pilot heart failure study showed improved exercise tolerance (+39m on
    6MWT) and quality of life. Xia 2020
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11292897/). Limited to HF
    patients. No general population mood data.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Potent carotenoid antioxidant from algae/seafood. Modest benefits for lipid\n\
  profile (LDL reduction) and blood pressure."
