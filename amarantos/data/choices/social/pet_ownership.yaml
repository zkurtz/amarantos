  description: "Recommended: especially dogs. Companion animals, particularly dogs.
    Swedish registry (n=3.4M): dog\nownership associated with 24% lower CVD mortality
    in single households.\nBenefits may include physical activity (dog walking), social
    facilitation,\nstress reduction. Cat ownership shows weaker/null associations.
    Evidence\nquality moderate; significant healthy user bias concerns."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Swedish registry (n=3.4M, 12y): dog ownership HR 0.76 for CVD mortality
    in single-person households. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29150611/).
    Meta-analysis: dog ownership HR 0.76 for CVD mortality, HR 0.87 for
    all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31592726/).
    Significant healthy user bias; healthier people may get dogs.
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Dog owners have higher physical activity levels. Pet interaction
    reduces cortisol and stress markers. No direct aging studies.
    Benefits likely mediated through activity and stress reduction.
    Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Pet owners report companionship, reduced loneliness, and daily
    structure. Dog walking provides social interactions. Grief at pet
    loss can be significant. Net positive effect for most owners.
    Small-moderate positive effect.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3

  associated with 24% lower CVD mortality in single households."
