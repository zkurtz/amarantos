domain: pharmaceutical
name: Statins (primary prevention in elevated risk)
summary: |
  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for cholesterol reduction. Strong evidence for
  secondary prevention. Primary prevention: meta-analyses show 14% all-cause
  mortality reduction in elevated CVD risk. Benefits depend on baseline risk.
  Side effects: myalgias (mostly nocebo), rare rhabdomyolysis. Evidence quality
  high; among best-studied medications.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      CTT meta-analysis (26 trials, n=170,000): per 1 mmol/L LDL reduction,
      10% lower all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22607822/).
      Primary prevention meta-analysis: HR 0.86 for all-cause mortality in
      elevated risk individuals. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22368587/).
      Benefits proportional to baseline CVD risk. High-quality causal evidence.
    mean: 0.88
    std: 0.05
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Statins reduce vascular aging and atherosclerosis progression.
      Anti-inflammatory effects (reduced CRP). No direct biological aging
      data. Benefits primarily through CVD risk reduction.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Myalgia reported by 5-10% but largely nocebo effect in blinded trials
      (same rate as placebo). Most people tolerate well. Daily pill burden.
      Generally neutral for wellbeing with appropriate patient selection.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.2
