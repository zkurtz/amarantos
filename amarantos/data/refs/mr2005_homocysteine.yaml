- summary: "Betaine supplementation (6g/day) increased LDL cholesterol by 0.36 mmol/L while lowering homocysteine"
  choice: b_vitamins_complex
  evidence_type: Randomized controlled trial
  effect_size: null

  outcome: "LDL cholesterol increase"
  population: "healthy adults"
  sample_size: 151

  notes: "3 studies combined; also increased triacylglycerol by 0.14 mmol/L; adverse lipid effects may counteract cardiovascular benefits of homocysteine reduction"
- summary: "Folic acid (0.8mg/day) had no effect on blood lipid concentrations while lowering homocysteine"

  notes: "2 studies combined; folic acid preferred for homocysteine-lowering due to neutral lipid effects"

summary: "Four randomized placebo-controlled studies in healthy humans examining homocysteine-lowering nutrients and blood lipids. Betaine (6g/day) increased LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerols, potentially counteracting cardiovascular benefits. Folic acid (0.8mg/day) had no effect on lipids, making it the preferred homocysteine-lowering treatment."
