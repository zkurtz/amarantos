summary: Commentary/review discussing spermidine as a physiological autophagy inducer
  with anti-aging properties. Epidemiological evidence from two cohorts (829 participants/15
  years and 1770 participants/13 years) showed individuals with high dietary spermidine
  intake had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease incidence and improved survival.
  Spermidine levels decline with aging, and healthy centenarians maintain blood levels
  similar to younger individuals.
