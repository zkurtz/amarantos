summary: Systematic umbrella review examining relationships between physical activity
  and mortality outcomes. Included 13 reviews on all-cause mortality, 6 on CVD mortality,
  and 10 on incident CVD, encompassing studies with up to 3.9 million participants.
  Found consistent inverse dose-response relationships with no evidence of harm at
  extreme volumes up to 4-10 times guideline recommendations.
