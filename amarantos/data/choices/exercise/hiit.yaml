  description: "Recommended: 20-30min, 2-3x/week. High-intensity interval training
    with alternating high/low intensity periods.\nMeta-analyses show 1.35 mL/kg/min
    greater VO2peak improvement vs moderate\ncardio. Each MET improvement associated
    with 8-17% lower all-cause mortality.\nGeneration 100: 37-49% lower mortality
    (NS) vs guidelines/MICT. Safe in cardiac\nrehab patients. Time-efficient. Evidence
    quality moderate-high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No direct mortality RCTs. Generation 100 study: 37% lower all-cause
    mortality vs guidelines, 49% lower vs MICT (NS). Each MET fitness
    improvement: 8-17% lower all-cause mortality.
    (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.118.009305). HIIT vs MICT
    meta-analysis: 1.15-1.78 mL/kg/min greater VO2peak improvement.
    Extrapolated from fitness improvements.
  mean: 0.72
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Improves cardiorespiratory fitness more efficiently than MICT. May
    improve mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. Some evidence
    for telomere preservation. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis: comparable quality of life effects to MICT. Time-efficient
    may improve adherence. Post-exercise endorphin release. Small positive
    effect likely.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3
summary: "High-intensity interval training with alternating high/low intensity periods.
  Meta-analyses show 1.35 mL/kg/min greater VO2peak improvement vs moderate\ncardio."
