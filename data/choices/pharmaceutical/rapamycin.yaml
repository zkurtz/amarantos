  description: "Recommended: low-dose, intermittent. mTOR inhibitor with most robust
    lifespan extension in animal models (9-14%\nin mice). Used in transplant medicine.
    Low-dose/intermittent protocols\nstudied for longevity. CAUTION: immunosuppressant,
    off-label use, limited\nhuman longevity data. Pearl trial (n=150) and RAAR trial
    ongoing. Evidence\nquality low for longevity; extrapolated from animals and transplant
    data."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No human longevity RCTs completed. Mouse studies: 9-14% lifespan
    extension even when started late-life. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19587680/).
    Transplant patients on rapalogs have mixed mortality (high-dose).
    CAUTION: immunosuppression at high doses. Highly speculative for
    healthy humans. Large uncertainty.
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.18
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    mTOR inhibition slows aging in multiple model organisms. Rapalogs
    improve immune function in elderly in short trials.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25540326/). Most consistent
    pharmacological lifespan extension in animals. Promising but very
    uncertain in humans.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 1.2
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Side effects at immunosuppressive doses: mouth sores, infections,
    metabolic effects. Low-dose may be better tolerated. Limited
    quality of life data. Uncertainty about side effect burden.
  mean: -0.1
  std: 0.4
summary: "mTOR inhibitor with most robust lifespan extension in animal models (9-14%\n\
  in mice). Used in transplant medicine."
