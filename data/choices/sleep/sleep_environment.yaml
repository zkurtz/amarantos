  description: "Recommended: dark, cool, quiet. Sleep environment optimization includes
    temperature (17-19°C/63-67°F optimal),\ndarkness (melatonin suppression from light),
    and noise (<35dB). Light exposure\nat night associated with obesity and depression
    in large cohorts. Cool\ntemperatures improve sleep quality. Evidence primarily
    mechanistic and from\nsleep quality studies; limited direct mortality data."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No direct mortality RCTs for sleep environment. UK Biobank: light
    exposure at night associated with obesity, depression, and CVD risk
    factors. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35970991/). Effect on
    mortality mediated through sleep quality and metabolic health.
    Indirect evidence; centered at null with uncertainty.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Light at night disrupts circadian rhythms and melatonin production.
    Melatonin has antioxidant properties. Temperature regulation affects
    sleep architecture and recovery. Likely supports healthy aging through
    improved sleep quality. Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Sleep environment interventions consistently improve sleep quality
    in RCTs. Noise reduction, darkness, and temperature optimization
    reduce sleep latency and improve sleep efficiency. Better sleep
    improves daytime functioning. Moderate positive effect.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Sleep environment optimization includes temperature (17-19°C/63-67°F optimal),\n\
  darkness (melatonin suppression from light), and noise (<35dB). Light exposure\n\
  at night associated with obesity and depression in large cohorts."
