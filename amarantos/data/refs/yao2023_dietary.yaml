summary: 'Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies with over 2.6 million participants examining dietary fiber and mortality. Found higher fiber intake associated with lower all-cause (RR 0.90), CVD (RR 0.87), and cancer mortality (RR 0.91). Protective effect relatively constant at daily intake above 15g. Non-linear relationship for all-cause, linear for others.'
