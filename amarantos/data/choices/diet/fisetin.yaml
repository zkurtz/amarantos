  description: "Recommended: intermittent dosing, dose TBD. Flavonoid senolytic found
    in strawberries. Extended lifespan 10% in mice by\nclearing senescent cells. Human
    trials (AFFIRM-LITE) ongoing. 2025 mouse study\nshowed improved grip strength
    and reduced frailty. Low bioavailability limits\ntranslation. No human mortality
    data. Evidence quality very low; highly\nspeculative but mechanistically promising."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No human mortality data. Mouse studies: fisetin extended median and
    maximum lifespan, improved tissue homeostasis.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6197652/). 2025 study: reduced
    frailty markers and improved physical function in old mice.
    (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70114). Human trials
    ongoing. Highly speculative estimate based on animal data.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.15
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Most potent senolytic among 10 flavonoids tested. Clears senescent cells
    and reduces SASP markers. DQ+Fisetin trials examining epigenetic clocks.
    (https://www.aging-us.com/article/205581/text). Strong mechanistic
    rationale but limited human data. Speculative.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 1.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No human wellbeing data. Reduced frailty in mice may translate to
    improved function. Purely speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
summary: "Flavonoid senolytic found in strawberries. Extended lifespan 10% in mice
  by\nclearing senescent cells."
