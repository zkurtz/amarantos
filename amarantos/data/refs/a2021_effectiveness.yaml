- summary: Intermittent fasting may improve body composition similarly to continuous
    energy restriction

  notes: Fat mass tended to decrease more with IF in 5 studies; lean mass losses comparable
    between approaches

summary: Meta-analysis of 18 randomized clinical trials comparing intermittent fasting
  (IF) versus continuous energy restriction (CER) in overweight and obese adults.
  Evaluated effects on anthropometric measurements, body composition, and lipid profiles.
  Found IF may provide comparable or slightly better results for weight loss, fat
  mass reduction, and lipid profile improvement compared to CER, though adherence
  results were inconclusive.
