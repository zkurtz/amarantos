    to some activity.\nNo upper limit of harm observed. Evidence quality very high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    AHA 30-year cohort (n=100K+): 300-600min/week moderate activity: 26-31%
    lower all-cause mortality, 28-38% lower CVD mortality.
    (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162).
    Cochrane CR meta-analysis: 26% lower CV mortality.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527136/). Causal and
    associative evidence; very robust.
  mean: 0.70
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Improves cardiorespiratory fitness strongly linked to biological aging.
    Reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. Associated with slower
    cognitive decline. Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 2.0
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Exercise consistently associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety/
    depression in meta-analyses. Improved sleep quality. May enhance social
    connections. Moderate-large positive effect.
