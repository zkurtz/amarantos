summary: "Meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials with 1,986 participants examining cocoa consumption effects on cardiometabolic risk markers. Found significant reductions in total cholesterol (-8.35 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (-9.47 mg/dL), fasting blood glucose (-4.91 mg/dL), systolic BP (-2.52 mmHg), and diastolic BP (-1.58 mmHg). No significant effects on body weight, BMI, triglycerides, HDL, or HbA1c. Studies used cocoa extract or >=70% dark chocolate for >=4 weeks."
