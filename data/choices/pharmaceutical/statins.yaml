  description: "Recommended: primary prevention in elevated risk. HMG-CoA reductase
    inhibitors for cholesterol reduction. Strong evidence for\nsecondary prevention.
    Primary prevention: meta-analyses show 14% all-cause\nmortality reduction in elevated
    CVD risk. Benefits depend on baseline risk.\nSide effects: myalgias (mostly nocebo),
    rare rhabdomyolysis. Evidence quality\nhigh; among best-studied medications."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    CTT meta-analysis (26 trials, n=170,000): per 1 mmol/L LDL reduction,
    10% lower all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22607822/).
    Primary prevention meta-analysis: HR 0.86 for all-cause mortality in
    elevated risk individuals. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22368587/).
    Benefits proportional to baseline CVD risk. High-quality causal evidence.
  mean: 0.88
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Statins reduce vascular aging and atherosclerosis progression.
    Anti-inflammatory effects (reduced CRP). No direct biological aging
    data. Benefits primarily through CVD risk reduction.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Myalgia reported by 5-10% but largely nocebo effect in blinded trials
    (same rate as placebo). Most people tolerate well. Daily pill burden.
    Generally neutral for wellbeing with appropriate patient selection.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.2
summary: "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for cholesterol reduction. Strong evidence
  for\nsecondary prevention."
