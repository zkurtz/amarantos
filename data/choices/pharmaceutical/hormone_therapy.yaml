  description: "Recommended: menopause/andropause. Estrogen/progesterone for menopause
    or testosterone for low-T. WHI trial\ncomplicated: timing matters (younger initiation
    safer). May improve quality\nof life and bone health. Testosterone may improve
    body composition and\nvitality. CAUTION: cancer, CVD risks depend on timing, formulation,
    and\nindividual factors. Evidence quality moderate-high but complex."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    WHI reanalysis: HRT initiated <10 years post-menopause HR 0.70 for
    mortality; >20 years post-menopause HR 1.17.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17341714/). KEEPS and ELITE trials
    support timing hypothesis. Testosterone: TRAVERSE trial showed CVD
    safety but no mortality data. Complex; individual risk assessment needed.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.12
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Hormones decline with age; replacement may slow some aging processes.
    Estrogen: bone protection, possible cognitive benefits. Testosterone:
    muscle, bone, body composition. Timing-dependent effects. Moderate
    uncertainty; depends on individual factors.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    HRT dramatically improves menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, sleep,
    mood). Testosterone improves energy, libido, mood in low-T men.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26914628/). Significant QoL
    improvement for symptomatic individuals. Moderate-large positive effect.
  mean: 0.6
  std: 0.4
summary: "Estrogen/progesterone for menopause or testosterone for low-T. WHI trial\n\
  complicated: timing matters (younger initiation safer)."
