summary: Prospective cohort study from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study following
  53,150 CVD-free participants for 23 years (14,088 CVD cases). Found that moderate
  vegetable nitrate intake (~60mg/day, equivalent to 1 cup of leafy greens) was associated
  with 15% lower CVD risk, with benefits plateauing at moderate intakes. Higher nitrate
  intake also associated with 12-26% lower risks of ischemic heart disease, heart
  failure, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. About 22% of effect mediated
  through blood pressure reduction.
