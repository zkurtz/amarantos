  description: "Recommended: 150-500mg/day. Polyphenol found in red grapes with extensive
    preclinical longevity data.\nHuman RCTs show mixed results: some BP reduction,
    inconsistent effects on\nlipids and inflammation. High doses (≥1000mg/day) may
    increase LDL. Conflicting\nfindings possibly due to gut microbiome variation.
    No mortality RCTs.\nTranslation from animal to human disappointing. Evidence quality
    low."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis shows some BP reduction and anti-
    inflammatory effects in CVD patients.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35905799/). High doses associated with
    increased LDL/TC. Inconsistent effects across trials.
    (https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/2/747). Clinical evidence does not
    support clear benefit. Centered at null.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Strong preclinical evidence for lifespan extension via SIRT1 activation.
    Human translation limited. No epigenetic clock studies show benefit.
    Speculative for human aging.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. May improve cognitive function in some populations.
    Limited evidence. Uncertain effect.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
summary: "Polyphenol found in red grapes with extensive preclinical longevity data.
  Human RCTs show mixed results: some BP reduction, inconsistent effects on\nlipids
  and inflammation."
