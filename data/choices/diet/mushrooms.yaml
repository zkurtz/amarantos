  description: "Recommended: 18g+/day. Contain ergothioneine (unique antioxidant)
    and beta-glucans. Meta-analysis of\ncohorts (n=602K): 6% lower all-cause mortality
    with consumption. 34% lower\ncancer risk in meta-analysis of 17 studies. Benefits
    for breast cancer most\nconsistent. Ergothioneine associated with 14% lower CVD
    mortality. Evidence\nquality moderate for mortality; cancer evidence has limitations."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of prospective cohorts (n=601,893): mushroom consumption
    associated with RR 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98) for all-cause mortality.
    (https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-021-00738-w).
    NHANES: HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.95) for mushroom consumers.
    Ergothioneine metabolite associated with HR 0.86 for mortality.
    Associative evidence.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Ergothioneine may protect against oxidative stress and age-related
    decline. Associated with healthy dietary patterns. No epigenetic clock
    studies. Speculative.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs. Part of healthy dietary patterns. Some medicinal
    mushrooms (different from culinary) have adaptogenic properties.
    Indirect evidence only.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Contain ergothioneine (unique antioxidant) and beta-glucans. Meta-analysis
  of\ncohorts (n=602K): 6% lower all-cause mortality with consumption."
