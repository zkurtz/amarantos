summary: 'Longitudinal study exploring the effects of senolytic interventions (dasatinib plus quercetin and fisetin) on DNA methylation clocks. Examined multiple epigenetic aging markers over time in participants taking these compounds. Study provides early data on whether senolytics can affect biological aging measures.'
