summary: Meta-analysis of 33 RCTs with 1,877 participants (947 RET, 930 control) examining
  resistance exercise training and depressive symptoms. Found moderate effect size
  (d=0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.83) with NNT of 4. Effects were independent of health status,
  exercise volume, and strength improvements. Blinded trials showed smaller effects,
  suggesting potential bias in unblinded studies.
