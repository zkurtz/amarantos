  description: "Recommended: 8-10 hour eating window. Limiting food intake to 8-10
    hour daily window, typically aligning with\ncircadian rhythms. Meta-analysis of
    19 RCTs: modest weight loss (1-3 kg),\nimproved insulin sensitivity. No mortality
    RCTs. Benefits may overlap with\ncaloric restriction. Earlier eating window (eTRE)
    shows better metabolic\noutcomes. Evidence quality moderate; mostly short-term
    studies."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs: improves insulin sensitivity,
    reduces BP, promotes weight loss. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33302500/).
    NHANES observational data: eating window <8h associated with higher CVD
    mortality (contradictory; confounding likely). Effect on mortality unclear.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Activates autophagy and cellular repair pathways during fasting periods.
    Animal studies show lifespan extension. Human aging data limited.
    Early TRE may improve circadian alignment. Mechanistically plausible.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May simplify eating decisions and improve meal satisfaction. Some
    report improved energy and mental clarity. Others find restriction
    challenging. Variable individual response. Small effect with
    uncertainty in direction.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Limiting food intake to 8-10 hour daily window, typically aligning with\n\
  circadian rhythms. Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs: modest weight loss (1-3 kg),\nimproved
  insulin sensitivity."
