  description: "Recommended: 7-8 hours/night. Sleep duration shows U-shaped mortality
    relationship. Meta-analyses consistently\nfind 7-8 hours optimal for adults. UK
    Biobank (n=498,277): both short (<6h) and\nlong (>8h) sleep associated with higher
    mortality. Short sleep HR 1.12, long\nsleep HR 1.30. Affects CVD, metabolic health,
    cognitive function. Evidence\nquality high from large prospective cohorts."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 1.3M participants: U-shaped curve with nadir at 7h.
    Short sleep (<6h) HR 1.12 (95% CI: 1.06-1.18), long sleep (>8h) HR 1.30
    (95% CI: 1.22-1.38). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20469800/). UK
    Biobank (n=498,277): similar findings. Note: long sleep may be marker
    of illness rather than causal. Strong associative evidence.
  mean: 0.88
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Chronic sleep deprivation accelerates biological aging. Short sleep
    associated with shorter telomeres, increased epigenetic age. Sleep
    is primary time for glymphatic clearance (brain waste removal).
    Meta-analysis: poor sleep associated with cognitive decline and
    dementia risk. Moderate-strong evidence.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Sleep deprivation consistently impairs mood, cognitive function, and
    daily functioning in experimental studies. Meta-analysis: sleep
    interventions improve wellbeing measures. Strong causal evidence
    from RCTs. Large positive effect.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 0.3
summary: "Sleep duration shows U-shaped mortality relationship. Meta-analyses consistently\n\
  find 7-8 hours optimal for adults."
