summary: 'Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs involving 127,477 participants with mean 5-year follow-up examining marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes. Found significant reductions in myocardial infarction (RR 0.92), CHD death (RR 0.92), and CVD death (RR 0.93). Risk reductions showed linear dose-response relationships with omega-3 dose.'
