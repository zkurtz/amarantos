  description: "Recommended: 81-100mg daily. Once standard primary prevention, now
    more nuanced. ASPREE trial (n=19,114,\nage 70+): no CVD benefit, increased bleeding.
    Benefits clearer for secondary\nprevention. May reduce colorectal cancer (NNT
    ~200 over 10-20 years).\nCAUTION: bleeding risk increases with age. Guidelines
    now recommend against\nroutine primary prevention in elderly. Evidence quality
    high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    ASPREE trial (n=19,114, age≥70, healthy): HR 1.14 for all-cause
    mortality with aspirin. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30221596/).
    Meta-analysis for primary prevention: no mortality benefit (HR 0.94,
    CI: 0.88-1.01), significant bleeding increase.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676625/). May reduce CRC mortality
    long-term. Complex risk-benefit; population-dependent.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No direct aging benefits. Anti-inflammatory effects theoretically
    relevant. ASPREE showed possible cognitive harm in elderly. Not
    recommended for aging prevention. Centered at null.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Generally well-tolerated. GI discomfort in some. Increased bruising.
    Peace of mind for some users; anxiety about bleeding for others.
    Essentially neutral for wellbeing.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.2
summary: "Once standard primary prevention, now more nuanced. ASPREE trial (n=19,114,\n\
  age 70+): no CVD benefit, increased bleeding."
