summary: 'Review article examining non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and its role in energy balance and obesity. NEAT encompasses all energy expenditure from non-exercise activities including fidgeting, standing, walking, and posture maintenance. Inter-individual variation in NEAT can reach 2000 kcal/day and appears to be biologically determined, playing a major role in weight regulation and resistance to obesity.'
