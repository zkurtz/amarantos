  description: "Recommended: 75-150 min/week. WHO alternative to moderate cardio:
    75-150min vigorous activity. PURE study\n(n=130K): ~35% reduction in CV mortality.
    AHA cohort: 21-23% lower all-cause\nmortality at 2-4x guidelines. Running, rowing,
    fast cycling, competitive\nsports. Greater time efficiency than moderate cardio.
    No upper limit of harm\nobserved. Evidence quality very high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    AHA 30-year cohort: 150-300min/week vigorous activity: 21-23% lower
    all-cause mortality. (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162).
    PURE study (n=130K+): vigorous activity ~35% lower CV mortality.
    Greatest benefit from sedentary to any activity. Causal and associative
    evidence.
  mean: 0.68
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Vigorous exercise most efficiently improves VO2max, strongly linked to
    biological aging. May improve mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative
    stress. Associated with slower cognitive decline. Strong biological
    plausibility.
  mean: 2.0
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Vigorous exercise associated with greater endorphin release ("runner's
    high"). Improved self-efficacy and body image. May enhance sleep quality.
    Moderate positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "WHO alternative to moderate cardio: 75-150min vigorous activity. PURE study\n\
  (n=130K): ~35% reduction in CV mortality."
