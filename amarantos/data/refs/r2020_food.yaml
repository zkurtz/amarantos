summary: Systematic review of 23 studies (2014-2020) examining time-restricted eating
  effects on human health. Found 80% adherence rate, 20% unintentional caloric reduction,
  average 3% weight loss and fat mass reduction. Metabolic benefits occurred independently
  of weight loss, suggesting intrinsic effects from circadian alignment.
