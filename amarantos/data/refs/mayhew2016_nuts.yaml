summary: "Systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 prospective cohort studies (467,389 participants) examining nut consumption and cardiovascular outcomes. Found nut consumption significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (19%), CVD mortality (27%), CHD mortality (30%), total CHD (34%), and sudden cardiac death. No significant association with stroke."
