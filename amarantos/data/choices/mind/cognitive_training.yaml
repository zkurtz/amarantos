  description: "Recommended: brain training, learning new skills. Includes computerized
    brain training, learning new languages, musical\ninstruments, or complex skills.
    Meta-analyses: limited transfer to\nreal-world cognition from brain games. However,
    education and cognitive\nengagement associated with lower dementia risk in observational
    studies.\nLearning complex skills may be more beneficial than narrow training.\n\
    Evidence quality low-moderate; transfer effects debated."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
  evidence: |
    ACTIVE trial: cognitive training associated with reduced dementia
    incidence at 10 years (HR 0.71). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28426831/).
    Higher education associated with lower mortality. Cognitive engagement
    may reduce dementia-related mortality. Indirect evidence.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.6
  evidence: |
    Cognitive reserve hypothesis: higher lifetime cognitive engagement
    delays dementia symptoms. NEJM study: cognitively stimulating leisure
    activities associated with reduced dementia risk.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12815136/). Associative evidence.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    Learning new skills provides sense of mastery and purpose. Flow
    states during skill acquisition associated with wellbeing. Social
    component of classes adds benefit. Small-moderate positive effect.
