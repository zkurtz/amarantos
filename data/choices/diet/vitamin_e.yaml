domain: diet
name: Vitamin E (avoid high-dose supplementation)
summary: |
  Fat-soluble antioxidant. CAUTION: Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (n=136K) found
  high-dose (≥400 IU/day) supplementation may INCREASE all-cause mortality.
  HOPE trial: no CVD prevention, may increase heart failure. Large RCTs show
  no benefit for cancer or CVD. Dietary sources (nuts, seeds, oils) sufficient
  for most. Supplementation not recommended. Evidence quality high for harm.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (n=135,967): high-dose (≥400 IU/day) associated
      with increased all-cause mortality in dose-dependent manner.
      (https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-142-1-200501040-00110).
      HOPE trial: no CVD benefit, may increase heart failure risk.
      (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200001203420302). Do not
      supplement with high doses.

  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Antioxidant effects not translated to human longevity benefits. RCTs
      show no anti-aging effects. May interfere with beneficial oxidative
      signaling. No benefit from supplementation.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No mood benefits demonstrated. High doses may cause GI distress. No
      evidence for positive effect; possible negative.
