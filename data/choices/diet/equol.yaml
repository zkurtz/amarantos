domain: diet
name: Equol (via soy isoflavones, 25-50mg/day)
summary: |
  Gut microbiome metabolite of daidzein (soy isoflavone) with greater estrogenic
  and antioxidant activity than parent compound. Only 25-30% of Western adults
  are "equol producers." Improves arterial stiffness (11-12% CVD risk reduction
  if sustained). Benefits limited to equol producers. Evidence quality low-moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 23 cohorts (n=330,826): isoflavone intake inversely
      associated with all-cause mortality but NOT CVD mortality specifically.
      RCT shows improved cfPWV in equol producers, equivalent to 11-12% CVD
      risk reduction if sustained. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26843154/).
      Benefit limited to ~30% who are equol producers. Speculative estimate.
    mean: 0.97
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Estrogenic effects may protect against age-related decline in women.
      Antioxidant properties. No epigenetic clock studies. Limited human
      longevity data. Speculative.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      May reduce menopausal symptoms in equol-producing women. Limited mood
      data. Effect depends on producer status. Uncertain.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.3
