summary: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of nicotinamide
  riboside (NR) in 20 older adults (65+) with mild cognitive impairment over 10 weeks.
  NR significantly increased blood NAD+ levels by 139% and was well-tolerated. Cognitive
  measures remained stable with no significant between-group differences. Modest trends
  suggested potential epigenetic aging reduction.
