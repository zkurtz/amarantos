  description: "Recommended: 3+ sessions/week. Includes yoga, tai chi, and dedicated
    stretching. Observational studies show\n13% lower all-cause mortality with regular
    practice. Improves range of motion,\nbalance, and reduces fall risk. Yoga/tai
    chi have additional mind-body benefits\nfor stress reduction. May improve arterial
    stiffness. Complements cardio and\nresistance training. Evidence quality low-moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Observational study: regular flexibility training HR 0.87 (95% CI:
    0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25559067/).
    Yoga and tai chi meta-analyses show improved BP and CVD risk factors.
    May reduce arterial stiffness. Associative evidence; limited direct
    mortality studies.
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Maintains mobility and range of motion with aging. Reduces fall risk
    in older adults. Yoga associated with reduced inflammation markers.
    May support joint health. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Yoga and tai chi consistently improve mood and reduce anxiety/depression
    in meta-analyses. Mindfulness component enhances stress management.
    Moderate positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Includes yoga, tai chi, and dedicated stretching. Observational studies
  show\n13% lower all-cause mortality with regular practice."
