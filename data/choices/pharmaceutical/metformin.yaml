domain: pharmaceutical
name: Metformin (off-label longevity use)
summary: |
  First-line diabetes medication studied for longevity. UK observational:
  diabetics on metformin had lower mortality than non-diabetic controls.
  TAME trial ongoing for primary prevention. Activates AMPK, mimics caloric
  restriction. May blunt exercise benefits. CAUTION: prescription drug with
  GI side effects. Evidence quality low for non-diabetics; extrapolated.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      UK CPRD study: diabetics on metformin had 15% lower mortality than
      matched non-diabetic controls. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25041462/).
      Meta-analysis in diabetics: reduced all-cause mortality vs other
      treatments. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28881964/). TAME trial
      for non-diabetics ongoing. Extrapolated; uncertain in healthy adults.
    mean: 0.90
    std: 0.12
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Activates AMPK, reduces IGF-1, mimics caloric restriction pathways.
      C. elegans and mouse studies show lifespan extension. Human biomarker
      studies show improved aging markers. CAUTION: may blunt exercise
      adaptations. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30548390/). Promising
      mechanistic basis; human aging data limited.
    mean: 0.8
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      GI side effects common (nausea, diarrhea) especially initially.
      Extended-release better tolerated. B12 deficiency with long-term use.
      No expected positive wellbeing effects. Small negative effect due
      to side effects.
    mean: -0.2
    std: 0.3
