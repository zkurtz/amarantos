  description: "Recommended: 8-11mg/day, adequate. Essential trace mineral for immune
    function and antioxidant defense. Meta-\nanalysis of 75 RCTs shows reduced TG,
    TC, FBG, CRP, IL-6. NHANES: higher\nintake associated with 21% lower CVD risk.
    All-cause mortality reduction NS\nin meta-analyses. Deficiency common in elderly
    and vegetarians. Both deficiency\nand excess harmful. Evidence quality moderate
    for CVD risk factors."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Umbrella review: zinc supplementation NS for all-cause mortality in
    general population. (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.798078/full).
    NHANES: higher dietary zinc associated with CVD risk reduction (OR 0.79).
    (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335524002456).
    Heart failure patients with low zinc have higher mortality. Dietary
    adequate intake preferred.
  mean: 0.96
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Essential for immune function and DNA repair. Deficiency accelerates
    immunosenescence. Low-dose long-term supplementation may benefit older
    adults. No epigenetic clock studies. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Deficiency causes fatigue and impaired cognitive function. Supports
    immune function (reduced infection duration). Supplementation in
    replete individuals unlikely to improve wellbeing.

summary: "Essential trace mineral for immune function and antioxidant defense. Meta-\n\
  analysis of 75 RCTs shows reduced TG, TC, FBG, CRP, IL-6."
