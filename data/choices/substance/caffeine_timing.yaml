domain: substance
name: Optimized Caffeine Timing (morning only, avoid afternoon)
summary: |
  Caffeine has 5-6 hour half-life; afternoon intake impairs sleep architecture
  even without subjective awareness. Coffee itself associated with 12-15% lower
  mortality in observational studies. Timing optimization maintains benefits
  while protecting sleep. Morning cortisol alignment recommended. Evidence
  quality moderate; coffee benefit strong, timing effects from sleep science.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis: 3-4 cups coffee/day associated with 12-15% lower
      all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28391017/).
      Benefits persist for decaf (polyphenols). Caffeine timing primarily
      affects sleep; sleep affects mortality. Optimal timing supports
      mortality benefit through sleep protection.
    mean: 0.88
    std: 0.05
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Coffee consumption associated with longer telomeres in observational
      studies. Polyphenols have antioxidant effects. Caffeine may enhance
      autophagy. Sleep disruption from poor timing accelerates aging.
      Net effect positive with proper timing.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Morning caffeine improves alertness and mood. Afternoon caffeine
      impairs sleep quality, reducing next-day wellbeing. Optimized timing
      provides alertness benefits without sleep cost. Moderate positive
      effect with good timing practices.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
