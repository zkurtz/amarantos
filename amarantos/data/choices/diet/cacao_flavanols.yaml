  description: "Recommended: 200-900mg/day. Cocoa flavanols improve cardiometabolic
    markers in RCTs: reduce BP, improve\nendothelial function (FMD), and modestly
    lower LDL. Large cohort studies show\n13-16% lower CVD mortality with chocolate
    consumption. Mechanisms include nitric\noxide activation and antioxidant effects.
    Evidence quality moderate; optimal\ndose not established."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Zhao 2022 meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies (n=878,990): highest vs lowest
    chocolate intake: 13% lower CVD mortality, 16% lower heart disease mortality,
    12% lower cancer mortality. Dose-response non-linear.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35460393/). Associative evidence; potential
    healthy user bias. 2024 RCT meta-analysis confirms improved cardiometabolic
    markers. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38931273/).
  mean: 0.87
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No epigenetic clock studies. Flavanols improve vascular function and may
    protect cognitive function. COSMOS trial showed cognitive benefits in older
    adults. Extrapolated from CVD risk reduction. Speculative.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    RCTs show improved mood and reduced fatigue with cocoa flavanols. May
    enhance cerebral blood flow. Small positive effect plausible. Limited
    direct wellbeing RCT data.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3
summary: "Cocoa flavanols improve cardiometabolic markers in RCTs: reduce BP, improve\n\
  endothelial function (FMD), and modestly lower LDL. Large cohort studies show\n\
  13-16% lower CVD mortality with chocolate consumption."
