  description: "Recommended: 1+ servings/day. Spinach, kale, arugula, lettuce rich
    in nitrates, vitamins, and fiber. NHS/HPFS:\neach serving associated with 11%
    lower CVD risk. Danish cohort (n=53,150):\nnitrate intake up to 60mg/day (≈1 cup)
    associated with lower IHD, stroke, PAD,\nand HF. Among strongest vegetable-CVD
    associations. Evidence quality high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2017 meta-analysis: green leafy vegetables inversely associated with CVD
    and all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28338764/).
    NHS/HPFS combined: each serving associated with 11% lower CVD risk.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8756059/). Danish cohort:
    vegetable nitrate intake associated with lower CVD events.
    (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00747-3).
    Associative evidence; consistent.
  mean: 0.88
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Nitrates improve vascular function and may slow cognitive decline. Rich
    in antioxidants and folate. Associated with healthy aging. No epigenetic
    clock studies. Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 0.8
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Part of healthy dietary patterns associated with better mood. Nitrates
    may improve exercise performance and energy. Indirect evidence only.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Spinach, kale, arugula, lettuce rich in nitrates, vitamins, and fiber. NHS/HPFS:\n\
  each serving associated with 11% lower CVD risk."
