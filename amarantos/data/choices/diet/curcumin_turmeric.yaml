  description: "Recommended: 500-2000mg/day. Polyphenol with potent anti-inflammatory
    effects. Meta-analysis of 103 RCTs\nshows significant effects on 55% of outcomes
    tested. Reduces CRP, IL-6, TNF-α.\nImproves lipid profile and glycemic markers.
    No mortality RCTs. Bioavailability\nenhanced with piperine or lipid formulations.
    Evidence quality moderate;\nsurrogate markers improved but hard endpoints lacking."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. 2024 comprehensive meta-analysis of 103 RCTs (n=7,216)
    shows significant effects on FBS, CRP, HDL, and weight with high credibility.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39478418/). Reduces inflammatory markers
    and improves ASCVD risk factors. Theoretical CVD benefit. Extrapolated
    estimate.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.7
  evidence: |
    Reduces markers of inflammaging (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). May protect against
    cognitive decline via anti-inflammatory effects. Animal studies suggest
    lifespan benefits. No human epigenetic clock data. Speculative.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    Meta-analyses show benefits for depression and cognitive function in
    some populations. May reduce joint pain in arthritis. Anti-inflammatory
    effects may improve overall wellbeing. Small positive effect plausible.
