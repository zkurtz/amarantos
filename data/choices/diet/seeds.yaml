  description: "Recommended: 1-2 tbsp/day. Rich in ALA omega-3, fiber, and lignans.
    Meta-analysis of chia: reduced TG\n(-9-13mg/dL), LDL (-5mg/dL), SBP (-3mmHg).
    Flax: 0-18% LDL reduction in studies.\nALA conversion to EPA/DHA is low (5-8%
    EPA, 0.5% DHA). NHS: highest ALA intake\nassociated with 40% lower sudden cardiac
    death. Evidence quality moderate;\ndirect mortality data limited."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No direct mortality RCTs. Nurses' Health Study: highest ALA intake
    associated with 40% lower sudden cardiac death. Chinese cohort: highest
    ALA intake 17% lower CVD mortality.

- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    High fiber content supports gut health and may reduce inflammation.
    Lignans (flax) have antioxidant properties. No epigenetic clock studies.
    Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    High fiber may improve digestion and regularity. Omega-3s support brain
    health. Limited direct mood data. Small positive effect plausible.
