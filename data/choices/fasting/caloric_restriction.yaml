  description: "Recommended: 15-25% below maintenance. Sustained caloric restriction
    without malnutrition. CALERIE trial: 15%\nreduction improved cardiometabolic markers,
    reduced oxidative stress. Strong\nlifespan extension in animal models (20-50%).
    Human lifespan data limited to\nobservational (Okinawa). CAUTION: muscle loss,
    reduced bone density, cold\nintolerance. Evidence quality moderate for biomarkers;
    limited for longevity."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    CALERIE trial (n=218, 2 years): 15% CR improved cardiometabolic markers,
    reduced inflammation (CRP -47%), oxidative stress.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291126/). Animal CR extends lifespan
    20-50%. Okinawan centenarians historically ate ~80% of typical calories.
    Strong mechanistic basis; limited human mortality data.
  mean: 0.85
  std: 0.12
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    CALERIE: CR slowed biological aging (~2-3% pace of aging reduction).
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749879/). Strong evidence in animal
    models for slowed aging. Best-studied longevity intervention.
    Moderate-high confidence for aging delay.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    CALERIE: sustained CR group reported improved mood and quality of life
    despite chronic mild hunger. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26839473/).
    Requires strong motivation. Long-term adherence difficult. Cold
    intolerance and reduced energy common. Mixed individual effects.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.4
summary: "Sustained caloric restriction without malnutrition. CALERIE trial: 15%\n\
  reduction improved cardiometabolic markers, reduced oxidative stress."
