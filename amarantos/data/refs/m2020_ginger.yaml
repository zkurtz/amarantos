summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 RCTs including 1,010 participants examining ginger supplementation effects on inflammatory markers. Found significant reductions in CRP (SMD = -5.11), hs-CRP (SMD = -0.88), and TNF-alpha (SMD = -0.85). No significant effects on IL-6 or sICAM levels.'
