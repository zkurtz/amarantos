domain: fasting
name: Caloric Restriction (15-25% below maintenance)
summary: |
  Sustained caloric restriction without malnutrition. CALERIE trial: 15%
  reduction improved cardiometabolic markers, reduced oxidative stress. Strong
  lifespan extension in animal models (20-50%). Human lifespan data limited to
  observational (Okinawa). CAUTION: muscle loss, reduced bone density, cold
  intolerance. Evidence quality moderate for biomarkers; limited for longevity.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      CALERIE trial (n=218, 2 years): 15% CR improved cardiometabolic markers,
      reduced inflammation (CRP -47%), oxidative stress.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291126/). Animal CR extends lifespan
      20-50%. Okinawan centenarians historically ate ~80% of typical calories.
      Strong mechanistic basis; limited human mortality data.
    mean: 0.85
    std: 0.12
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      CALERIE: CR slowed biological aging (~2-3% pace of aging reduction).
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36749879/). Strong evidence in animal
      models for slowed aging. Best-studied longevity intervention.
      Moderate-high confidence for aging delay.
    mean: 1.5
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      CALERIE: sustained CR group reported improved mood and quality of life
      despite chronic mild hunger. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26839473/).
      Requires strong motivation. Long-term adherence difficult. Cold
      intolerance and reduced energy common. Mixed individual effects.
    mean: 0.1
    std: 0.4
