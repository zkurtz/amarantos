domain: sleep
name: Optimized Sleep Environment (dark, cool, quiet)
summary: |
  Sleep environment optimization includes temperature (17-19°C/63-67°F optimal),
  darkness (melatonin suppression from light), and noise (<35dB). Light exposure
  at night associated with obesity and depression in large cohorts. Cool
  temperatures improve sleep quality. Evidence primarily mechanistic and from
  sleep quality studies; limited direct mortality data.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No direct mortality RCTs for sleep environment. UK Biobank: light
      exposure at night associated with obesity, depression, and CVD risk
      factors. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35970991/). Effect on
      mortality mediated through sleep quality and metabolic health.
      Indirect evidence; centered at null with uncertainty.
    mean: 0.95
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Light at night disrupts circadian rhythms and melatonin production.
      Melatonin has antioxidant properties. Temperature regulation affects
      sleep architecture and recovery. Likely supports healthy aging through
      improved sleep quality. Speculative.
    mean: 0.3

  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Sleep environment interventions consistently improve sleep quality
      in RCTs. Noise reduction, darkness, and temperature optimization
      reduce sleep latency and improve sleep efficiency. Better sleep
      improves daytime functioning. Moderate positive effect.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
