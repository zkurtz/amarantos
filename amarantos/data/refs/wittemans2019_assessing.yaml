summary: Mendelian randomization study assessing causal association between glycine
  and cardio-metabolic diseases. Meta-analysis of GWAS in 80,003 participants identified
  27 genetic loci. Found glycine is genetically associated with lower CHD risk (HR=0.92
  per 1SD higher glycine), partially driven by blood pressure effects. Evidence for
  glycine-T2D association may be driven by glycine-lowering effect of insulin resistance.
