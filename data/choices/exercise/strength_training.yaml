domain: exercise
name: Strength Training (2x/week, ~60 min total)
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 11 studies, n=370,256 (Saeidifard et al. 2019).
      Any resistance training vs none: HR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69-0.91), 21% lower mortality.
      Dose-response meta-analysis shows U-shaped curve: maximum benefit ~60 min/week
      (RR 0.73), diminishing returns above 130 min/week.
      Mostly cohort studies; associative evidence with possible healthy user bias.
      One RCT included; borderline CVD mortality reduction (HR 0.83, CI: 0.67-1.03).
    mean: 0.79
    std: 0.056
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Limited direct evidence on biological age markers.
      Resistance training preserves muscle mass, bone density, and functional capacity.
      Some studies show improved telomere length maintenance with exercise.
      Extrapolated from mortality: 21% reduction roughly corresponds to 2-3 years.
      Moderate confidence given strong mechanistic plausibility.
    mean: 2.0
    std: 1.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      JAMA Psychiatry meta-analysis of 33 RCTs, n=1,877 (Gordon et al. 2018).
      Resistance training vs control: SMD -0.66 (95% CI: -0.48 to -0.83) for depression.
      Number needed to treat = 4.
      Causal evidence from RCTs.
      Effects independent of health status or strength gains.
      Young people show larger effects (Hedge's g = -1.06).
    mean: 0.7
    std: 0.2
