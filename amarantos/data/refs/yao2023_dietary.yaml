summary: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies
  with over 2.6 million participants examining dietary fiber and mortality. Found
  higher fiber intake associated with lower all-cause (RR 0.90), CVD (RR 0.87), and
  cancer mortality (RR 0.91). Protective effect relatively constant at daily intake
  above 15g. Non-linear relationship for all-cause, linear for others.
