summary: 'Meta-analysis of 11 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (>55,000 participants) examining calcium supplements and CVD risk. Neither calcium alone (7 trials, n=8,634) nor calcium plus vitamin D (6 trials, n=46,804) showed significant excess risk for MI, CHD, or stroke. Studies could only exclude CVD risk increases greater than 0.3-0.5% per year.'
