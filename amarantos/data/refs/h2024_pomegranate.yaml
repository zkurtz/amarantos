summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 RCTs examining pomegranate consumption on blood pressure in adults. Found significant reductions in both systolic (-7.87 mmHg) and diastolic (-3.23 mmHg) blood pressure. Effects were more pronounced in individuals with baseline SBP exceeding 130 mmHg. High heterogeneity across studies noted.'
