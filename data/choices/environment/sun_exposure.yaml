domain: environment
name: Moderate Sun Exposure (10-30 min/day, avoiding burns)
summary: |
  Balancing vitamin D synthesis and skin cancer risk. Swedish cohort (n=29,518):
  sun avoidance as harmful as smoking for mortality. Vitamin D deficiency
  associated with multiple diseases. Optimal: regular moderate exposure without
  burning. Latitude, skin type, and season affect needs. Evidence quality
  moderate; J-shaped relationship with extremes harmful.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Swedish cohort (n=29,518, 20y): sun avoidance HR 2.0 for all-cause
      mortality vs highest exposure. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992108/).
      Vitamin D deficiency meta-analysis: HR 1.35 for mortality.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25111121/). Skin cancer mortality
      (~2% of skin cancer deaths) much lower than CVD/all-cause risks.
      Moderate exposure optimal.
    mean: 0.85
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Vitamin D supports bone health, immune function, muscle strength.
      Excessive UV exposure accelerates skin aging (photoaging). Balance
      needed. Moderate exposure supports healthy vitamin D without
      excessive photoaging. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Sunlight exposure improves mood (bright light therapy effective for
      depression). Regulates circadian rhythms. Outdoor time associated
      with improved mental health. Moderate positive effect on wellbeing.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
