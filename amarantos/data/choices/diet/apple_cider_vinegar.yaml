  description: "Recommended: 15-30ml/day. Modest benefits for blood glucose and lipid
    control in diabetics. Reduces\nfasting glucose by ~20mg/dL and HbA1c by ~0.5-1.5%.
    No mortality data. May aid\nmodest weight loss. Safe as food but can erode tooth
    enamel. Evidence from\nsmall trials; no long-term outcome studies."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality studies exist for ACV. Benefits are on intermediate markers
    (glucose, lipids) which may reduce long-term CVD risk, but this is
    speculative extrapolation. Centered at null with uncertainty reflecting
    possible small benefit via metabolic improvements.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.1
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No aging-specific studies. Acetic acid may activate AMPK pathway linked
    to longevity in animal models. Human translation unknown. Highly
    speculative; large uncertainty.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood/wellbeing RCTs. Improved glycemic control may indirectly
    benefit energy levels in diabetics. Sour taste may be aversive for some.
    No evidence for direct mood effects.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.2
summary: "Modest benefits for blood glucose and lipid control in diabetics. Reduces\n\
  fasting glucose by ~20mg/dL and HbA1c by ~0.5-1.5%."
