summary: "Randomized controlled trial comparing immediate vs delayed treatment groups in 56 physically inactive employees (mean age 47.68, 93% female) from a UK university. Intervention consisted of three 30-minute group-led lunchtime walks weekly over 10 weeks. Used ecological momentary assessment via mobile phones to capture real-time mood changes. Found improvements in enthusiasm, relaxation, and reduced nervousness at work, suggesting brief physical activity breaks during work hours positively influence employee mood."
