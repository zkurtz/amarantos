summary: 'NIA Interventions Testing Program study across 3 research sites examining glycine supplementation in genetically heterogeneous mice. 8% glycine diet (started at 9 months) extended median lifespan by approximately 4-6% in both sexes (p=0.002 males, p=0.006 females). Glycine-treated mice less likely to die from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Effects described as modest.'
