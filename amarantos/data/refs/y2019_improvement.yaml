summary: 'Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining Hericium erinaceus (Lion''s mane) mushroom supplementation and cognitive function over 12 weeks in middle-aged and elderly participants. Found oral intake significantly improved cognitive functions measured by MMSE, Benton visual retention test, and verbal paired-associate learning test. Proposed mechanism involves hericenones acting on brain neural networks.'
