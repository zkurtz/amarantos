  description: "Recommended: 3-7x/week, 15-30min. Lower temperature (45-65°C) heat
    therapy. Meta-analysis of 7 studies in heart\nfailure: improved ejection fraction,
    reduced BNP. Improves endothelial function.\nLess studied than Finnish sauna for
    mortality outcomes. Generally safe and\nbetter tolerated than traditional sauna.
    No effect on cholesterol. Evidence\nquality low-moderate; extrapolated from Finnish
    sauna and mechanistic studies."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No direct mortality studies for infrared sauna. Meta-analysis in heart
    failure (n=491): improved LVEF and reduced BNP with 2-4 weeks therapy.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6489706/). Far-infrared
    improves endothelial function similar to Finnish sauna.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2718593/). Extrapolated
    from Finnish sauna data with higher uncertainty.
  mean: 0.85
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Similar heat shock protein induction to Finnish sauna. May improve
    mitochondrial function. Less studied for aging outcomes. Speculative.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Relaxation and stress reduction similar to Finnish sauna. Better
    tolerated due to lower temperatures. May improve chronic pain.
    Small-moderate positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3
summary: "Lower temperature (45-65°C) heat therapy. Meta-analysis of 7 studies in
  heart\nfailure: improved ejection fraction, reduced BNP."
