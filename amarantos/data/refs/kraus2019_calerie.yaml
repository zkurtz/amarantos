summary: "CALERIE phase 2 multicenter RCT of 218 healthy non-obese adults (ages 21-50, BMI 22.0-27.9) randomized to 25% caloric restriction (n=143) or ad libitum control (n=75) for 2 years. CR group achieved 11.9% calorie reduction and sustained 7.5kg weight loss (71% fat mass). Showed significant improvements in LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, metabolic syndrome score, and insulin sensitivity, suggesting potential long-term cardiovascular benefits even in healthy populations."
