domain: diet
name: Quercetin (500-1000mg/day)
summary: |
  Flavonoid with antioxidant and potential senolytic effects. Meta-analyses show
  modest BP reduction (-3mmHg SBP in hypertensives), reduced LDL and fasting
  glucose. Senolytic effects (with dasatinib) promising in preclinical models;
  human trials ongoing. Single-agent senolytic effects uncertain. No mortality
  RCTs. Evidence quality low-moderate.

  - outcome: Relative mortality risk

      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis: SBP reduction -3.19mmHg in hypertensives,
      reduced LDL and total cholesterol.

      Senolytic when combined with dasatinib (D+Q). May clear senescent cells
