summary: 'Meta-analysis of 24 RCTs involving 57,952 participants examining B vitamin supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes. Found no significant effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (RR 0.98), all-cause mortality (RR 1.01), cardiac death (RR 0.96), MI (RR 0.99), or stroke (RR 0.94). Concluded B vitamins do not reduce cardiovascular risk in primary or secondary prevention.'
