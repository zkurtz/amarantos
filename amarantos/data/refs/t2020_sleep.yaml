summary: "Prospective study from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) examining 1,992 cardiovascular disease-free participants with 7-day wrist actigraphy measurements and 4.9 years follow-up. Found that irregular sleep patterns are novel CVD risk factors: sleep duration variability >120 minutes (HR 2.14) and sleep timing variability >90 minutes (HR 2.11) were associated with increased CVD risk, independent of traditional risk factors and sleep quantity/quality."
