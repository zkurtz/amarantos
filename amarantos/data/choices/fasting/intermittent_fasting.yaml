  description: "Recommended: 5:2 or alternate day. Periodic caloric restriction including
    5:2 (2 days/week at 500-600 kcal) or\nalternate day fasting. Meta-analyses show
    similar weight loss to continuous\nrestriction. May improve insulin sensitivity
    and lipid profiles. Adherence\nvariable. No mortality RCTs. Effects likely overlap
    with caloric restriction.\nEvidence quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis: similar metabolic improvements to
    continuous caloric restriction. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28459931/).
    Ramadan fasting observational studies show mixed results. Effect on
    mortality extrapolated from metabolic benefits. Speculative.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Periodic fasting activates autophagy, reduces IGF-1, and may promote
    cellular renewal. Animal models show lifespan benefits. Human aging
    data very limited. Mechanistically promising. Speculative.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    On fasting days: hunger, reduced energy, possible irritability.
    Non-fasting days: normal eating freedom. Some report improved
    relationship with food long-term. Adherence challenges for many.
    Mixed effect; individual variation high.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.4
summary: "Periodic caloric restriction including 5:2 (2 days/week at 500-600 kcal)
  or\nalternate day fasting. Meta-analyses show similar weight loss to continuous\n\
  restriction."
