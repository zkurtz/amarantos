domain: exercise
name: HIIT (20-30min, 2-3x/week)
summary: |
  High-intensity interval training with alternating high/low intensity periods.
  Meta-analyses show 1.35 mL/kg/min greater VO2peak improvement vs moderate
  cardio. Each MET improvement associated with 8-17% lower all-cause mortality.
  Generation 100: 37-49% lower mortality (NS) vs guidelines/MICT. Safe in cardiac
  rehab patients. Time-efficient. Evidence quality moderate-high.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No direct mortality RCTs. Generation 100 study: 37% lower all-cause
      mortality vs guidelines, 49% lower vs MICT (NS). Each MET fitness
      improvement: 8-17% lower all-cause mortality.
      (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.118.009305). HIIT vs MICT
      meta-analysis: 1.15-1.78 mL/kg/min greater VO2peak improvement.
      Extrapolated from fitness improvements.
    mean: 0.72
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Improves cardiorespiratory fitness more efficiently than MICT. May
      improve mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. Some evidence
      for telomere preservation. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis: comparable quality of life effects to MICT. Time-efficient
      may improve adherence. Post-exercise endorphin release. Small positive
      effect likely.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.3
