summary: Landmark study demonstrating that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, extends lifespan
  in mice even when treatment begins late in life (600 days). Female mice showed 14%
  lifespan extension and males showed 9% extension. Study was replicated across three
  independent test sites using genetically heterogeneous mice.
