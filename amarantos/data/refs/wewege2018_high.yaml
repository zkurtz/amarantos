summary: 'Systematic review evaluating safety of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for patients with cardiovascular disease in cardiac rehabilitation settings. Analyzed 23 studies with 1,117 participants (547 HIIT, 570 MICT). Found only one major cardiovascular adverse event related to HIIT, equating to 1 event per 17,083 training sessions, demonstrating relatively low risk.'
