summary: Prospective cohort study from the Framingham Offspring Cohort examining 1,391
  dementia-free participants (mean age 60.9 years). Found higher concurrent dietary
  choline intake associated with better verbal and visual memory performance. Higher
  remote choline intake (measured 7 years prior) was associated with reduced white-matter
  hyperintensity volume on brain MRI. Verbal learning and executive function showed
  no significant associations with choline intake.
