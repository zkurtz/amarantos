summary: ASPREE randomized controlled trial of 19,114 healthy community-dwelling adults
  aged 70+ (median 74 years, 56.4% women) comparing 100mg daily aspirin vs placebo
  over median 4.7 years. Found no benefit for disability-free survival (HR 1.01, 95%
  CI 0.92-1.11) but significantly increased major hemorrhage (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62).
