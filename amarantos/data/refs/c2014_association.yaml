summary: Cumulative meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled trials (57,952 participants,
  follow-up 0.7-7.3 years) examining B vitamin supplementation and cardiovascular
  outcomes. Found no significant effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),
  total mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Authors conclude
  routine B vitamin supplementation for cardiovascular prevention lacks clinical justification.
