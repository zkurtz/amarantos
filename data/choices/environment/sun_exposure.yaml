  description: "Recommended: 10-30 min/day, avoiding burns. Balancing vitamin D synthesis
    and skin cancer risk. Swedish cohort (n=29,518):\nsun avoidance as harmful as
    smoking for mortality. Vitamin D deficiency\nassociated with multiple diseases.
    Optimal: regular moderate exposure without\nburning. Latitude, skin type, and
    season affect needs. Evidence quality\nmoderate; J-shaped relationship with extremes
    harmful."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Swedish cohort (n=29,518, 20y): sun avoidance HR 2.0 for all-cause
    mortality vs highest exposure. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992108/).
    Vitamin D deficiency meta-analysis: HR 1.35 for mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25111121/). Skin cancer mortality
    (~2% of skin cancer deaths) much lower than CVD/all-cause risks.
    Moderate exposure optimal.
  mean: 0.85
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Vitamin D supports bone health, immune function, muscle strength.
    Excessive UV exposure accelerates skin aging (photoaging). Balance
    needed. Moderate exposure supports healthy vitamin D without
    excessive photoaging. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Sunlight exposure improves mood (bright light therapy effective for
    depression). Regulates circadian rhythms. Outdoor time associated
    with improved mental health. Moderate positive effect on wellbeing.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Balancing vitamin D synthesis and skin cancer risk. Swedish cohort (n=29,518):\n\
  sun avoidance as harmful as smoking for mortality."
