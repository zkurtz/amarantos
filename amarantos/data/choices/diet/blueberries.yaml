  description: "Recommended: 1+ servings/day. Among the most evidence-backed fruits
    for cardiovascular health. Associated\nwith ~21% lower all-cause mortality and
    32% lower MI risk in cohorts.\nAnthocyanins improve endothelial function (FMD
    +1.5%). RCTs show reduced BP\nand LDL. Rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. Strong
    observational evidence;\nmoderate RCT support."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.85
  std: 0.05
  evidence: |
    NHANES cohort: blueberry consumers vs non: HR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66-0.95)
    for all-cause mortality. Meta-analysis of anthocyanin intake: RR 0.89
    for CVD, 32% lower MI risk. Cassidy 2013
    (https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(24)00021-X/pdf). Associative
    evidence; healthy user bias possible.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.8
  evidence: |
    Anthocyanins may protect against cognitive decline. Some studies show
    improved memory in older adults. No epigenetic clock data. Extrapolated
    from mortality and cognitive benefits. Moderate confidence.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.2
  evidence: |
    RCTs show improved cognitive function and mood in older adults with
    blueberry supplementation. Krikorian 2020 showed memory benefits.
    Limited direct mood data. Small positive effect plausible.
