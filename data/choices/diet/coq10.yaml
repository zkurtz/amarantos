  description: "Recommended: 100-300mg/day. Mitochondrial cofactor essential for ATP
    production. Strong RCT evidence in\nheart failure: 36% reduced mortality (2024
    meta-analysis), Q-SYMBIO trial\nshowed 42% reduction in all-cause mortality. Reduces
    BP modestly. In general\npopulation, no mortality benefit observed. Benefits primarily
    in cardiac\npatients and older adults with declining CoQ10 levels."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2024 meta-analysis of 33 RCTs in heart failure: RR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48-0.85)
    for all-cause mortality, moderate GRADE quality.
    (https://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-024-04232-z).
    Q-SYMBIO trial: 42% reduction in all-cause mortality, 43% reduction in MACE.
    (https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2014.06.008). 2025 NHANES cohort:
    no association in general population (HR 1.00).
    (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.70019). Causal evidence
    strong in HF patients only.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    CoQ10 levels decline with age. Supports mitochondrial function. Animal
    studies suggest lifespan benefits. No human epigenetic clock studies.
    May slow age-related decline in cellular energy. Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May reduce fatigue, especially in those with mitochondrial dysfunction
    or statin-induced myopathy. Limited mood RCT data. Small energy
    improvement plausible in older adults.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Mitochondrial cofactor essential for ATP production. Strong RCT evidence
  in\nheart failure: 36% reduced mortality (2024 meta-analysis), Q-SYMBIO trial\n\
  showed 42% reduction in all-cause mortality."
