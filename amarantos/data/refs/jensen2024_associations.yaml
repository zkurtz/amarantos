summary: "Cross-sectional study of 50 adults (median age 56.5, median BMI 32.1) examining associations between accelerometer-measured physical activity and gastrointestinal transit times using wireless motility capsules. Found that high light-intensity physical activity was associated with more rapid colonic and whole gut transit times, independent of age, sex, and body fat."
