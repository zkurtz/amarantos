summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 RCTs examining non-surgical periodontal therapy effects on CVD risk markers. Found significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, and systolic blood pressure (moderate certainty evidence). No significant effects on lipid profiles (LDL, HDL, TC, TG), IL-1B, TNF-a, diastolic blood pressure, or flow-mediated dilatation.'
