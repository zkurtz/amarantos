  description: "Recommended: 55-200mcg/day, adequate. Trace mineral essential for
    antioxidant defense. Meta-analysis of 43 RCTs:\nselenium alone shows NO effect
    on CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality. However,\nwhen part of antioxidant mixtures,
    associated with 23% lower CVD mortality and\n10% lower all-cause mortality. U-shaped
    risk curve; both deficiency and excess\nharmful. Excess may increase prostate
    cancer mortality. Evidence mixed."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Jenkins 2020 meta-analysis of 43 RCTs: selenium alone NS for mortality.
    When selenium part of antioxidant mix: RR 0.77 for CVD mortality, RR 0.90
    for all-cause mortality. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7727482/).
    Cochrane review: NS effects on CVD/all-cause mortality.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7433291/). U-shaped curve.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Essential for selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense. Deficiency
    accelerates aging. No benefit from supplementation in replete individuals.
    No epigenetic clock studies. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Deficiency causes fatigue and thyroid dysfunction. Supplementation in
    deficient individuals may improve energy. No benefit in replete
    individuals.
  mean: 0.0

summary: "Trace mineral essential for antioxidant defense. Meta-analysis of 43 RCTs:\n\
  selenium alone shows NO effect on CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality."
