  description: "Recommended: 2+ servings/week. Associated with 16% lower CVD risk
    and 21% lower CHD risk in large cohorts.\nRich in monounsaturated fats, fiber,
    potassium. RCTs show modest LDL reduction\n(~4-9mg/dL). No direct mortality trials.
    Evidence quality low-moderate due to\nobservational designs and small RCTs."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Prospective cohort, n=110,487 over 30 years. ≥2 servings/week vs rarely:
    HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75-0.95) for CVD, HR 0.79 for CHD. Associative evidence.
    Pacheco 2022 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35352568/). No all-cause
    mortality data; estimate based on CVD reduction.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No epigenetic clock studies. Rich in antioxidants and healthy fats.
    Extrapolated from CVD risk reduction. Speculative.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    No direct mood RCTs for avocado. Contains folate and healthy fats linked
    to brain health. Insufficient evidence for effect estimate.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
summary: Associated with 16% lower CVD risk and 21% lower CHD risk in large
  cohorts. Rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, potassium.
