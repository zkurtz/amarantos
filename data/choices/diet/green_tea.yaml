  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 38 cohorts (n=1,956,549): RR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95) for
      all-cause mortality, RR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79-0.94) for CVD mortality at
      highest intake. (https://www.e-epih.org/journal/view.php?number=1522).
      Three meta-analyses support 18-33% CVD mortality reduction.
