domain: diet
name: Blueberries (1+ servings/day)
summary: |
  Among the most evidence-backed fruits for cardiovascular health. Associated
  with ~21% lower all-cause mortality and 32% lower MI risk in cohorts.
  Anthocyanins improve endothelial function (FMD +1.5%). RCTs show reduced BP
  and LDL. Rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. Strong observational evidence;
  moderate RCT support.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      NHANES cohort: blueberry consumers vs non: HR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66-0.95)
      for all-cause mortality. Meta-analysis of anthocyanin intake: RR 0.89
      for CVD, 32% lower MI risk. Cassidy 2013
      (https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(24)00021-X/pdf). Associative
      evidence; healthy user bias possible.
    mean: 0.85
    std: 0.05
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Anthocyanins may protect against cognitive decline. Some studies show
      improved memory in older adults. No epigenetic clock data. Extrapolated
      from mortality and cognitive benefits. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      RCTs show improved cognitive function and mood in older adults with
      blueberry supplementation. Krikorian 2020 showed memory benefits.
      Limited direct mood data. Small positive effect plausible.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.2
