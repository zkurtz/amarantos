summary: 'Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 9 articles (17 studies, 478,847 participants, 27,860 mortality cases) examining cycling and mortality. Found linear inverse relationship for all-cause mortality (9% reduction per 5 MET-h/week) and U-shaped pattern for CVD mortality with optimal benefit at approximately 15 MET-h/week of cycling.'
