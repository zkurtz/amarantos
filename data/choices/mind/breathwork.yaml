  description: "Recommended: slow breathing, box breathing. Deliberate breathing techniques
    including slow breathing (5-6 breaths/min),\nbox breathing, and resonance breathing.
    Activates parasympathetic nervous\nsystem, reduces HRV, lowers BP. Meta-analysis:
    reduces anxiety comparable\nto relaxation techniques. Less studied than meditation.
    Evidence quality\nlow-moderate; mostly small studies."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No direct mortality studies. Slow breathing reduces blood pressure
    by 3-4 mmHg in meta-analysis. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31875792/).
    Improves HRV, a marker of autonomic health. Effect on mortality
    extrapolated from physiological improvements. Highly speculative.
  mean: 0.98
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Improved HRV associated with lower biological age. Parasympathetic
    activation may reduce chronic stress burden. No direct aging studies.
    Speculative extrapolation from stress physiology.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis: slow breathing reduces anxiety with moderate effect
    (d=0.35). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32209269/). Acute stress
    reduction well-documented. Can be practiced anywhere. Small-moderate
    positive effect.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3
summary: "Deliberate breathing techniques including slow breathing (5-6 breaths/min),\n\
  box breathing, and resonance breathing. Activates parasympathetic nervous\nsystem,
  reduces HRV, lowers BP."
