summary: 'Prospective cohort study of 134,796 Chinese adults (73,360 women, 61,436 men) examining cruciferous vegetable intake and mortality. Found significant inverse dose-response relationships for total mortality (HR 0.78 for highest vs lowest quintile) and CVD mortality (HR 0.69), but no significant association with cancer mortality.'
