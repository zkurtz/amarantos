summary: Prospective cohort study of 433,268 UK Biobank adults aged 38-73 with average
  6.5 years follow-up and 10,534 deaths. Found definite evening chronotype associated
  with 10% increased all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18) compared
  to definite morning types. Evening types also showed elevated prevalence of psychological
  disorders (OR 1.94) and cardiometabolic risk factors. Suggests chronic circadian
  misalignment may contribute to mortality risk.
