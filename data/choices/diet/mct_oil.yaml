domain: diet
name: MCT Oil (15-30mL/day)
summary: |
  Medium-chain triglycerides rapidly converted to ketones, providing alternative
  brain fuel. Meta-analysis shows mild ketosis and possible cognitive improvement
  in MCI/AD patients. May enhance working memory in older adults. No mortality
  data. GI side effects common. May increase triglycerides in some. Evidence
  quality low for cognition; no CVD data.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. May increase plasma triglycerides in some individuals,
      which could be harmful for CVD. No cardiovascular outcomes studied.
      Coconut oil (high MCT) used widely without major adverse events. Centered
      at null with uncertainty.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      May support brain energy metabolism in aging. Meta-analysis shows
      cognitive benefits in MCI/AD. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7050425/).

      Speculative for healthy aging.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      May improve mental clarity via ketones. GI side effects (nausea, cramping)
      common and may reduce wellbeing. Net effect uncertain.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.3
