  description: "Recommended: 3-5g/day. Green algae rich in chlorophyll, vitamins (B12,
    D), and protein. Meta-analyses\nshow modest reductions in total cholesterol (~9mg/dL),
    LDL (~8mg/dL), blood\npressure, and fasting glucose. No mortality RCTs. Generally
    safe; may support\ndetoxification. Evidence quality low-moderate due to heterogeneous
    study designs."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (n=797) shows reduced TC
    (-9mg/dL), LDL-C (-8mg/dL), SBP (-4.5mmHg), DBP (-1.6mmHg), and FBG
    (-4.2mg/dL). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29037431/). 2025 GRADE-assessed
    review confirms lipid benefits with high certainty for TC/LDL.

    Theoretical CVD benefit; extrapolated estimate.
  mean: 0.97
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Contains growth factors and antioxidants. No human aging studies.
    May support cellular detoxification. Animal studies suggest immune
    benefits. Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May improve energy via B12 content. Some studies report improved
    immune markers. Limited direct wellbeing data. GI side effects possible.
    Small effect plausible.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Green algae rich in chlorophyll, vitamins (B12, D), and protein. Meta-analyses\n\
  show modest reductions in total cholesterol (~9mg/dL), LDL (~8mg/dL), blood\npressure,
  and fasting glucose."
