summary: Prospective cohort study of 29,518 Swedish women aged 25-64 followed for
  20 years examining sun exposure habits and mortality. Found that women who avoided
  sun exposure had 0.6-2.1 years shorter life expectancy, with nonsmokers who avoided
  sun having similar mortality to smokers in the highest sun exposure group. Reduced
  mortality was primarily due to lower cardiovascular and non-cancer deaths.
