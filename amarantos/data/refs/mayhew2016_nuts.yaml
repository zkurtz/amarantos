summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 prospective cohort studies (467,389
  participants) examining nut consumption and cardiovascular outcomes. Found nut consumption
  significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (19%), CVD mortality (27%),
  CHD mortality (30%), total CHD (34%), and sudden cardiac death. No significant association
  with stroke.
