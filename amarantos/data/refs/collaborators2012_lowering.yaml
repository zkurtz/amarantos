summary: 'Individual participant data meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials (n=174,149) examining statin therapy for LDL cholesterol lowering. Per 1 mmol/L LDL reduction, statin therapy reduced major vascular events by 21% (RR 0.79). Benefits were proportionally greater in lowest-risk groups (RR 0.62 for <5% 5-year risk). In individuals with <10% risk, statins prevented ~11 major vascular events per 1000 over 5 years. No increased cancer incidence.'
