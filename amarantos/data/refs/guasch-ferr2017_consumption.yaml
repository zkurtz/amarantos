summary: Prospective cohort study of 210,836 participants from NHS, NHSII, and HPFS
  with over 5 million person-years follow-up. Found total nut consumption (5+ servings/week
  vs never) associated with 14% lower CVD risk (HR 0.86) and 20% lower CHD risk (HR
  0.80). Walnut consumption (1+ times/week) was associated with 13-19% lower CVD and
  15-23% lower CHD risk.
