summary: Prospective cohort study of 469 community-dwelling adults over age 75 with
  median 5.1-year follow-up. Found cognitive leisure activities (reading, board games,
  musical instruments, dancing) associated with reduced dementia risk (HR 0.93 per
  1-point increment). Physical activity alone showed no significant protective effect.
  124 dementia cases observed.
