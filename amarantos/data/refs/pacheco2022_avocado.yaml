summary: 'Prospective cohort study of 110,487 US adults (68,786 women, 41,701 men) followed for 30 years. Higher avocado consumption (2+ servings/week) associated with 16% lower CVD risk (HR 0.84) and 21% lower coronary heart disease risk (HR 0.79). Replacing margarine, butter, eggs, or processed meats with avocado linked to 16-22% lower CVD risk.'
