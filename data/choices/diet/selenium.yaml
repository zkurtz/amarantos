domain: diet
name: Selenium (55-200mcg/day, adequate)
summary: |
  Trace mineral essential for antioxidant defense. Meta-analysis of 43 RCTs:
  selenium alone shows NO effect on CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality. However,
  when part of antioxidant mixtures, associated with 23% lower CVD mortality and
  10% lower all-cause mortality. U-shaped risk curve; both deficiency and excess
  harmful. Excess may increase prostate cancer mortality. Evidence mixed.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk

      Jenkins 2020 meta-analysis of 43 RCTs: selenium alone NS for mortality.
      When selenium part of antioxidant mix: RR 0.77 for CVD mortality, RR 0.90
      for all-cause mortality. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7727482/).

  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Essential for selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense. Deficiency
      accelerates aging. No benefit from supplementation in replete individuals.
      No epigenetic clock studies. Speculative.

    std: 0.5
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Deficiency causes fatigue and thyroid dysfunction. Supplementation in
      deficient individuals may improve energy. No benefit in replete
      individuals.
