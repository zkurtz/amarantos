domain: diet
name: Ashwagandha (300-600mg/day)
summary: |
  Adaptogenic herb with significant anxiolytic effects. Meta-analyses show
  large reductions in stress/anxiety scales (SMD ~1.5) and cortisol levels.
  No mortality data. Generally safe short-term; long-term safety less studied.
  Evidence quality is low-moderate due to small trials and heterogeneity.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality studies. Reduces cortisol and stress markers which are
      associated with chronic disease, but causal link to mortality unproven.
      Centered at null with small uncertainty band reflecting theoretical
      benefit via stress reduction.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.1
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No epigenetic clock studies. Reduces cortisol and oxidative stress markers.
      Some animal studies suggest lifespan effects. Human aging data absent.
      Speculative.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 15 RCTs, n=873. Significant reductions in anxiety
      (SMD -1.55) and stress (SMD -1.75). Also reduces cortisol levels.
      Causal evidence from RCTs but low certainty due to heterogeneity.
