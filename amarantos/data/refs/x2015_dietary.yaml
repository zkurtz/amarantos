summary: 'Dose-response meta-analysis of 13 prospective cohort studies (252,164 participants, 15,040 CVD cases) examining dietary iron intake and CVD risk. Found heme iron specifically increases CVD risk (RR 1.07 per 1 mg/day), while non-heme iron (RR 0.98) and total dietary iron (RR 1.00) showed no significant association.'
