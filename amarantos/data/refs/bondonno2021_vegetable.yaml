summary: "Prospective cohort study from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study following 53,150 CVD-free participants for 23 years (14,088 CVD cases). Found that moderate vegetable nitrate intake (~60mg/day, equivalent to 1 cup of leafy greens) was associated with 15% lower CVD risk, with benefits plateauing at moderate intakes. Higher nitrate intake also associated with 12-26% lower risks of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. About 22% of effect mediated through blood pressure reduction."
