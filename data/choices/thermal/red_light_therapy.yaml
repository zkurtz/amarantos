  description: "Recommended: 600-1000nm, daily 10-20min. Photobiomodulation using
    red/near-infrared light (600-1000nm). Umbrella review\nof RCTs: 17% moderate,
    57% low, 26% very low certainty evidence. Best evidence\nfor skin rejuvenation
    (collagen), wound healing, and chronic pain (NNT=4).\nMay improve muscle endurance.
    No mortality or longevity data. Small studies,\noptimal protocols unclear. Evidence
    quality low-moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality studies. Umbrella review of 35 meta-analyses: mostly low
    certainty evidence. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12326686/).
    May improve metabolic markers in some populations. Purely speculative
    for mortality.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    May improve skin quality (collagen synthesis). Potentially improves
    mitochondrial function via cytochrome c oxidase. RCT showed improved
    sleep in mild insomnia. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9855677/).
    Limited human aging data. Speculative.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis: 2.8-point VAS pain reduction for chronic pain (NNT=4).
    May improve skin appearance and self-perception. Limited mood data.
    Small positive effect for pain conditions.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Photobiomodulation using red/near-infrared light (600-1000nm). Umbrella
  review\nof RCTs: 17% moderate, 57% low, 26% very low certainty evidence."
