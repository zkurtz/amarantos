summary: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 prospective cohort studies examining
  chocolate consumption and mortality. The primary study followed 27,111 men from
  the ATBC cohort. Meta-analysis of 908,390 participants found moderate chocolate
  consumption associated with lower cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause
  mortality. Mediation analysis suggested 4.3% of protective effect operates through
  blood pressure reduction.
