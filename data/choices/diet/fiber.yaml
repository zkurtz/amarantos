  description: "Recommended: 25-30g/day. Among the most evidence-backed dietary interventions.
    2023 meta-analysis of\n64 studies (n=3.5M): 23% lower all-cause mortality, 26%
    lower CVD mortality,\n22% lower cancer mortality for highest intake. Insoluble
    fiber and whole grain\nsources most effective. Dose-response steeper below 15g/day.
    Evidence quality\nhigh."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2023 meta-analysis of 64 studies (n=3,512,828): highest vs lowest fiber
    intake: HR 0.77 for all-cause, HR 0.74 for CVD, HR 0.78 for cancer
    mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38011755/). Dose-response
    meta-analysis: per 10g/day increase: RR 0.90 for all-cause, 0.87 for CVD.
    (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1153165/full).
    Fiber from nuts/seeds: 43% lower CVD mortality. Associative evidence;
    highly consistent.
  mean: 0.82
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Supports gut microbiome health. May reduce inflammation and improve
    metabolic markers. Associated with healthy aging patterns. No epigenetic
    clock studies. Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Improved gut health may enhance mood via gut-brain axis. Reduces
    constipation and GI discomfort. Indirect evidence only.
