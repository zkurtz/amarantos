  description: "Recommended: 0.5-3mg/day, short-term. Hormone regulating circadian
    rhythm. Meta-analysis shows improved sleep quality\n(PSQI -1.24). CAUTION: 2025
    AHA study found long-term use in insomnia associated\nwith 89% higher HF risk
    and 2x mortality (may reflect underlying conditions\nrather than causation). Short-term
    use appears safe; long-term safety uncertain.\nEvidence quality low for safety."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    2025 AHA study (n=130,828): long-term melatonin users had HR 2.09 for
    all-cause mortality vs matched controls. HF incidence HR 1.89.
    (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606).
    Authors note association may reflect underlying conditions, not causation.
    Not peer-reviewed. Short-term likely safe; long-term uncertain. Estimate
    reflects uncertainty.

    Antioxidant properties. Supports circadian rhythm which affects aging.
    Animal studies suggest longevity benefits. Safety concerns from 2025
    study add uncertainty. Speculative.

  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 23 RCTs shows improved sleep quality (PSQI -1.24).
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33417003/). Better sleep improves
    daytime functioning. Short-term benefit likely.
