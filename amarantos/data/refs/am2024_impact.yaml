summary: Umbrella meta-analysis synthesizing 10 meta-analyses involving 8,610 participants
  examining magnesium supplementation effects on blood pressure. Found modest but
  significant reductions in both systolic (-1.25 mmHg) and diastolic (-1.40 mmHg)
  blood pressure. Higher doses (>=400mg/day) showed more substantial effects (-6.38
  mmHg SBP, -3.71 mmHg DBP). Suggests magnesium may be useful as adjunctive therapy
  with antihypertensive medications.
