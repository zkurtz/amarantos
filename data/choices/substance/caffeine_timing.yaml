  description: "Recommended: morning only, avoid afternoon. Caffeine has 5-6 hour
    half-life; afternoon intake impairs sleep architecture\neven without subjective
    awareness. Coffee itself associated with 12-15% lower\nmortality in observational
    studies. Timing optimization maintains benefits\nwhile protecting sleep. Morning
    cortisol alignment recommended. Evidence\nquality moderate; coffee benefit strong,
    timing effects from sleep science."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis: 3-4 cups coffee/day associated with 12-15% lower
    all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28391017/).
    Benefits persist for decaf (polyphenols). Caffeine timing primarily
    affects sleep; sleep affects mortality. Optimal timing supports
    mortality benefit through sleep protection.
  mean: 0.88
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Coffee consumption associated with longer telomeres in observational
    studies. Polyphenols have antioxidant effects. Caffeine may enhance
    autophagy. Sleep disruption from poor timing accelerates aging.
    Net effect positive with proper timing.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Morning caffeine improves alertness and mood. Afternoon caffeine
    impairs sleep quality, reducing next-day wellbeing. Optimized timing
    provides alertness benefits without sleep cost. Moderate positive
    effect with good timing practices.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Caffeine has 5-6 hour half-life; afternoon intake impairs sleep architecture\n\
  even without subjective awareness. Coffee itself associated with 12-15% lower\n\
  mortality in observational studies."
