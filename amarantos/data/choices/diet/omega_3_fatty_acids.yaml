  description: "Recommended: EPA/DHA, 1g+/day. Omega-3 supplementation (1g+/day) reduces
    CV mortality and MI risk but has\nnull effect on all-cause mortality in RCTs.
    Small antidepressant effect\n(SMD -0.28). EPA monotherapy more effective than
    EPA+DHA. Note: may increase\natrial fibrillation risk. Mixed evidence overall."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 42 RCTs, n=176,253. CV mortality reduced (p=0.02) but
    all-cause mortality NOT significant. MI: HR ~0.92. EPA > EPA+DHA combo.
    Moderate dose (0.8-1.2g) optimal for MACE. Causal evidence from RCTs.
    Increased AFib risk noted. Mattumpuram 2025

  mean: 0.96
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No direct epigenetic clock studies. Some reduced inflammation markers
    (CRP, IL-6). Telomere studies inconclusive. Cannot extrapolate from
    mortality since all-cause effect is null. Highly speculative; centered
    at zero with large uncertainty.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 1.0
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 26 RCTs, n=2,160. SMD -0.28 (p=0.004) for depression.
    Small but significant. EPA-rich > DHA-dominant. Causal evidence. More
    effective as adjunct than standalone. Liao 2019
    (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0515-5).
  mean: 0.25
  std: 0.15
summary: "Omega-3 supplementation (1g+/day) reduces CV mortality and MI risk but has\n\
  null effect on all-cause mortality in RCTs. Small antidepressant effect\n(SMD -0.28)."
