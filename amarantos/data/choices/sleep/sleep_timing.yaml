  description: "Recommended: regular schedule, earlier chronotype. Sleep timing regularity
    and chronotype affect health outcomes. UK Biobank\n(n=433,268): evening chronotype
    associated with 10% higher mortality vs\nmorning type. Sleep irregularity (>60min
    variability) linked to metabolic\ndysfunction and CVD risk. Circadian alignment
    may be as important as\nduration. Evidence quality moderate from large cohorts."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    UK Biobank (n=433,268): evening chronotype HR 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02-1.18)
    vs morning type for all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29669607/).
    Sleep irregularity associated with metabolic syndrome and CVD risk.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31672995/). Shift work associated
    with increased mortality. Associative evidence; confounding possible.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Circadian disruption accelerates cellular aging in animal models.
    Shift workers show accelerated cognitive decline. Regular sleep
    timing supports hormonal regulation and repair processes.
    Limited direct human aging data. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Evening types report higher rates of depression and anxiety.
    Social jet lag (weekend-weekday mismatch) associated with worse
    mood and cognitive performance. Circadian alignment improves
    daytime alertness. Moderate positive effect.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Sleep timing regularity and chronotype affect health outcomes. UK Biobank\n\
  (n=433,268): evening chronotype associated with 10% higher mortality vs\nmorning
  type."
