domain: exercise
name: Stretching/Flexibility (3+ sessions/week)
summary: |
  Includes yoga, tai chi, and dedicated stretching. Observational studies show
  13% lower all-cause mortality with regular practice. Improves range of motion,
  balance, and reduces fall risk. Yoga/tai chi have additional mind-body benefits
  for stress reduction. May improve arterial stiffness. Complements cardio and
  resistance training. Evidence quality low-moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Observational study: regular flexibility training HR 0.87 (95% CI:
      0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25559067/).
      Yoga and tai chi meta-analyses show improved BP and CVD risk factors.
      May reduce arterial stiffness. Associative evidence; limited direct
      mortality studies.
    mean: 0.90
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Maintains mobility and range of motion with aging. Reduces fall risk
      in older adults. Yoga associated with reduced inflammation markers.
      May support joint health. Moderate confidence.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Yoga and tai chi consistently improve mood and reduce anxiety/depression
      in meta-analyses. Mindfulness component enhances stress management.
      Moderate positive effect likely.
    mean: 0.4
    std: 0.3
