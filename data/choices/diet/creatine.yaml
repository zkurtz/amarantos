domain: diet
name: Creatine Monohydrate (3-5g/day)
summary: |
  Well-studied ergogenic aid. Meta-analyses show cognitive benefits: improved
  memory (SMD 0.31) and attention, especially in older adults. Enhances muscle
  strength and lean mass with exercise. No mortality RCTs. Safe for long-term
  use (up to 2 years studied). May benefit brain health via enhanced cellular
  energy.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Improves muscle strength and functional capacity in
      older adults, which is associated with lower mortality risk. May preserve
      brain function. Indirect evidence only. Extrapolated estimate with high
      uncertainty.
    mean: 0.97
    std: 0.10
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Supports muscle mass preservation (sarcopenia prevention). 2024 meta-analysis
      shows cognitive benefits including memory (SMD 0.31).
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11275561/). May protect brain
      during metabolic stress. No epigenetic clock data. Moderate confidence
      for functional aging.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Enhanced exercise capacity and strength gains may improve physical
      self-efficacy. Cognitive benefits may improve mental clarity. Some
      evidence for mood benefits. Small positive effect likely.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.3
