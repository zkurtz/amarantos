summary: Systematic review of 6 RCTs examining medium-chain triglyceride supplementation
  and memory in non-demented older adults. Found MCT supplementation may enhance working
  memory, with effects more prominent in individuals with lower baseline scores. MCTs
  induce nutritional ketosis which may provide neuroprotection. Further studies needed
  to confirm optimal dose and composition.
