summary: Review of 9 peer-reviewed studies examining far-infrared sauna therapy for
  cardiovascular risk factors. Found moderate evidence for benefits in congestive
  heart failure (improved ejection fraction, walking distance) and fair evidence for
  blood pressure reduction (10-15 mm Hg systolic). No evidence for cholesterol reduction.
  Limited by small sample sizes and single research group.
