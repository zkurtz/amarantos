- summary: Astaxanthin supplementation hypothesized to improve antioxidant capacity,
    inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure patients
  choice: astaxanthin
  source_type: expert opinion
  notes: Protocol paper for an 8-week double-blind RCT in 80 heart failure patients
    (stages C and D) receiving 20 mg astaxanthin daily. First trial to explore astaxanthin

summary: Protocol paper for an 8-week double-blind randomized controlled trial of
  20 mg daily astaxanthin supplementation in 80 heart failure patients (stages C and
  D). Primary outcome is total antioxidant capacity; secondary outcomes include inflammatory
  markers (CRP, TNF-alpha), oxidative stress indices, lipid profile, blood pressure,
  endothelial function, and quality of life. First trial of its kind in heart failure.
  Recruitment began August 2024.
