summary: "Umbrella review analyzing 5 meta-analyses of 18 randomized controlled trials on quercetin supplementation effects on cardiometabolic outcomes. Found significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-1.9 mmHg) and insulin levels. No significant effects on diastolic blood pressure, lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, or body weight. Evidence certainty ranged from very low to moderate."
