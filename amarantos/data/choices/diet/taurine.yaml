  description: "Recommended: 500-3000mg/day. Sulfur amino acid with strong 2023 Science
    paper showing lifespan extension\nin mice/monkeys and healthspan benefits. Meta-analyses
    show reduced BP, fasting\nglucose, and TG in humans. 2025 NIH study questions
    taurine as aging biomarker.\nDeclines with age; supplementation may restore levels.
    Found in meat, fish,\ndairy. Evidence quality moderate; human longevity data pending."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. 2023 Science: taurine supplementation extended lifespan
    in mice and healthspan in monkeys. (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257).
    2024 meta-analysis of 25 RCTs: reduced BP, FBG, TG in humans.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325608/). Promising but human
    longevity trials needed. Extrapolated estimate.
  mean: 0.94
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    2023 Science: reduced cellular senescence, protected telomeres, improved
    mitochondrial function in animals. Extended C. elegans lifespan 10-23%.
    2025 NIH study: taurine unlikely to be good aging biomarker in humans.
    (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-researchers-conclude-taurine-unlikely-be-good-aging-biomarker).
    High uncertainty.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 1.0
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May support cardiovascular and brain function. Found in energy drinks
    (though effects may be caffeine-driven). Limited direct mood RCT data.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Sulfur amino acid with strong 2023 Science paper showing lifespan extension\n\
  in mice/monkeys and healthspan benefits. Meta-analyses show reduced BP, fasting\n\
  glucose, and TG in humans."
