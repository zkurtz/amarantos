summary: 'Randomized, single-blind, active-controlled trial of 17 critically ill COVID-19 patients at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan. ALA (1200 mg/d IV for 7 days) showed trend toward lower 30-day mortality (37.5% vs 77.8%, P=0.09) and smaller SOFA score increase compared to placebo. Study underpowered due to small sample size; larger trials warranted.'
