summary: Meta-analysis of 15 international cohort studies involving 47,471 adults
  with 3,013 deaths over median 7.1-year follow-up examining daily steps and all-cause
  mortality. Found 53% lower mortality risk for highest vs lowest step quartile (HR
  0.47). Optimal thresholds were 6,000-8,000 steps/day for adults 60+ and 8,000-10,000
  for younger adults, challenging the popular 10,000-step guideline. Stepping intensity
  also independently associated with lower mortality.
