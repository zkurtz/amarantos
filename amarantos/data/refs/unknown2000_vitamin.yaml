summary: "HOPE Study randomized controlled trial of 9,541 high-risk patients (age 55+ with cardiovascular disease or diabetes plus one risk factor) randomized to 400 IU vitamin E daily or placebo for 4.5 years. Found no significant difference in primary composite outcome of MI, stroke, and CV death (16.2% vs 15.5%, RR 1.05). Vitamin E had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes, contradicting earlier observational studies suggesting benefit."
