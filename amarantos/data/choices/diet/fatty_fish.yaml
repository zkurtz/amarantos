  description: "Recommended: 2+ servings/week. Salmon, sardines, mackerel rich in
    omega-3 (EPA/DHA). Meta-analysis of 25\ncohorts (n=2M): 9% lower CVD mortality,
    4% reduction per 20g/day. RCTs of\nomega-3 supplements show reduced cardiovascular
    mortality. Benefits more\nconsistent for fish intake than supplements. Evidence
    quality high for\nobservational; RCTs mixed."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 25 cohorts (n=2,027,512): fish consumption associated
    with 9% lower CVD mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.98). Marine n-3
    PUFA intake: RR 0.87 for CVD mortality.
    (https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2342). 2021 meta-analysis of 38 RCTs:
    omega-3 reduced cardiovascular mortality.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8413259/). Associative and
    causal evidence.
  mean: 0.91
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Omega-3s reduce inflammation and may protect telomere length. Associated
    with slower cognitive decline. No epigenetic clock studies for fish
    specifically. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.7
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Omega-3s show modest benefits for depression in meta-analyses. May
    improve brain health. Small positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Salmon, sardines, mackerel rich in omega-3 (EPA/DHA). Meta-analysis of 25\n\
  cohorts (n=2M): 9% lower CVD mortality, 4% reduction per 20g/day."
