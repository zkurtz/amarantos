  description: "Recommended: 2+ times/week. Full-body cardio with minimal joint impact.
    UK cohort (n=80K): 28% lower all-\ncause mortality, 41% lower CVD mortality vs
    non-swimmers. Compared to sedentary,\nswimming HR 0.66 for all-cause, 0.48 for
    CVD mortality in older adults. Suitable\nfor all ages, joint conditions, and rehabilitation.
    Improves lipid profile and\nBP. Evidence quality moderate-high."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    UK cohort (n=80,306): swimming HR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.80) for all-cause
    mortality, HR 0.59 (95% CI: 0.46-0.75) for CVD mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27895075/). Swimmers had 53% lower
    all-cause mortality vs sedentary, 49% lower vs runners.
    (https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/ijare/vol2/iss3/3/). Associative evidence.
  mean: 0.72
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Cardiorespiratory fitness strongly linked to biological aging. Low
    joint impact preserves mobility into older age. May improve flexibility.
    Strong biological plausibility.
  mean: 1.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Swimming associated with improved mental health and stress reduction.
    Water-based exercise particularly beneficial for chronic pain. Social
    component at pools. Moderate positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.3
summary: "Full-body cardio with minimal joint impact. UK cohort (n=80K): 28% lower
  all-\ncause mortality, 41% lower CVD mortality vs non-swimmers."
