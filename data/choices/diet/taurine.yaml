domain: diet
name: Taurine (500-3000mg/day)
summary: |
  Sulfur amino acid with strong 2023 Science paper showing lifespan extension
  in mice/monkeys and healthspan benefits. Meta-analyses show reduced BP, fasting
  glucose, and TG in humans. 2025 NIH study questions taurine as aging biomarker.
  Declines with age; supplementation may restore levels. Found in meat, fish,
  dairy. Evidence quality moderate; human longevity data pending.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. 2023 Science: taurine supplementation extended lifespan
      in mice and healthspan in monkeys. (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257).
      2024 meta-analysis of 25 RCTs: reduced BP, FBG, TG in humans.
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325608/). Promising but human
      longevity trials needed. Extrapolated estimate.
    mean: 0.94
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      2023 Science: reduced cellular senescence, protected telomeres, improved
      mitochondrial function in animals. Extended C. elegans lifespan 10-23%.
      2025 NIH study: taurine unlikely to be good aging biomarker in humans.
      (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-researchers-conclude-taurine-unlikely-be-good-aging-biomarker).
      High uncertainty.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 1.0
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      May support cardiovascular and brain function. Found in energy drinks
      (though effects may be caffeine-driven). Limited direct mood RCT data.
    mean: 0.1
    std: 0.3
