  description: "Recommended: brushing 2x/day, flossing. Periodontal disease linked
    to systemic inflammation and CVD. Meta-analyses:\nperiodontal disease associated
    with 20-40% higher CVD risk. Regular brushing\n(2x/day) associated with lower
    CVD events. Oral bacteria can enter bloodstream.\nFlossing evidence weaker but
    supports gum health. Simple, low-cost intervention.\nEvidence quality moderate;
    associative."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Korean cohort (n=247,696): brushing 3x/day associated with 10% lower
    CVD events. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31843538/). Meta-analysis:
    periodontal disease HR 1.20-1.40 for CVD.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22909730/). Tooth loss associated with
    higher mortality. Good oral hygiene may reduce systemic inflammation.
    Associative; confounding with SES and health behaviors.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Tooth loss associated with faster cognitive decline. Periodontal
    bacteria found in Alzheimer's brains. Chronic inflammation from
    poor oral health may accelerate aging. Maintaining oral health
    supports healthy aging. Moderate indirect evidence.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.5
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Dental pain significantly impacts quality of life. Fresh breath
    and healthy teeth support social confidence. Dental anxiety can
    be barrier. Routine oral care is generally positive for wellbeing.
    Small positive effect.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.2
summary: "Periodontal disease linked to systemic inflammation and CVD. Meta-analyses:\n\
  periodontal disease associated with 20-40% higher CVD risk."
