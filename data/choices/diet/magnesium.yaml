  description: "Recommended: 300-400mg/day. Essential mineral involved in 300+ enzymatic
    reactions. Dietary intake\nassociated with 6% lower all-cause mortality per 100mg/day;
    supplementation\nreduces BP by 2-3mmHg (RCTs). Greater benefits in hypertensives
    and those with\nhypomagnesemia (-7.7mmHg SBP). Many adults deficient. Dietary
    sources preferred.\nEvidence quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Dose-response meta-analysis: each 100mg/day dietary magnesium associated
    with 6% lower all-cause mortality and 5% lower cancer mortality.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33684200/). Supplementation not shown
    to reduce mortality in RCTs. 2024 umbrella meta-analysis: supplementation
    reduces SBP by -1.25mmHg, DBP by -1.40mmHg.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11401110/). Dietary benefits;
    supplementation for BP only.
  mean: 0.94
  std: 0.05
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Involved in DNA repair and cellular energy production. Deficiency
    associated with accelerated aging. May support mitochondrial function.
    No epigenetic clock studies. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Deficiency causes fatigue, muscle cramps, and anxiety. Supplementation
    may improve sleep and reduce anxiety in deficient individuals. Limited
    RCT evidence in replete individuals.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Essential mineral involved in 300+ enzymatic reactions. Dietary intake\n\
  associated with 6% lower all-cause mortality per 100mg/day; supplementation\nreduces
  BP by 2-3mmHg (RCTs)."
