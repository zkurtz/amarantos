  description: "Recommended: 20+ min/day. Regular meditation includes mindfulness,
    transcendental, and focused attention\npractices. Meta-analyses show reduced anxiety,
    depression, and stress. May\nlower blood pressure (3-5 mmHg). Limited direct mortality
    data. Improves\nemotional regulation and attention. Effects comparable to first-line\n\
    treatments for anxiety. Evidence quality moderate from RCTs."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No large mortality RCTs. TM practitioners showed reduced CVD mortality
    in small trial (n=201). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23149426/).
    Meta-analysis: meditation reduces BP by 3-5 mmHg, comparable to lifestyle
    interventions. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28384004/). Effect on
    mortality extrapolated from CVD risk factor improvements. Speculative.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Small studies suggest meditation may slow epigenetic aging and preserve
    telomere length. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23092711/). Reduces
    chronic stress and inflammation markers. Limited and mixed evidence.
    Plausible but speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 47 RCTs (n=3,515): moderate effect on anxiety (d=0.38),
    depression (d=0.30), and stress (d=0.33). (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24395196/).
    Effects comparable to CBT for anxiety. Improves emotional regulation
    and life satisfaction. Moderate-large positive effect.
  mean: 0.6
  std: 0.3
summary: "Regular meditation includes mindfulness, transcendental, and focused attention\n\
  practices. Meta-analyses show reduced anxiety, depression, and stress."
