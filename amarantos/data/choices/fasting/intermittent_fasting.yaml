  description: "Recommended: 5:2 or alternate day. Periodic caloric restriction including
    5:2 (2 days/week at 500-600 kcal) or\nalternate day fasting. Meta-analyses show
    similar weight loss to continuous\nrestriction. May improve insulin sensitivity
    and lipid profiles. Adherence\nvariable. No mortality RCTs. Effects likely overlap
    with caloric restriction.\nEvidence quality moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.10
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 18 RCTs: similar weight loss and metabolic
    improvements to continuous caloric restriction. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293678/).
    Ramadan fasting observational studies show mixed results. Effect on
    mortality extrapolated from metabolic benefits. Speculative.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.4
  std: 0.7
  evidence: |
    Periodic fasting activates autophagy, reduces IGF-1, and may promote
    cellular renewal. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35310455/). Animal
    models show lifespan benefits. Human aging data very limited.
    Mechanistically promising. Speculative.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.4
  evidence: |
    On fasting days: hunger, reduced energy, possible irritability.
    Non-fasting days: normal eating freedom. Some report improved
    relationship with food long-term. Adherence challenges for many.
    Mixed effect; individual variation high.
