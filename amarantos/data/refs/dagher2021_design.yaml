summary: 'Phase II randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial design (Q-CABG)
  at Montreal Heart Institute. 100 patients scheduled for CABG following acute coronary
  syndrome randomized 1:1 to quercetin 500mg twice daily or placebo, starting 2-3
  days pre-surgery through postoperative day 7. Primary endpoints: hs-CRP, hs-troponin
  T, and angiopoietin-like 2 (senescence marker). Secondary endpoint: endothelial
  function via internal mammary artery assessment.'
