summary: Comprehensive Global Burden of Disease analysis of alcohol use across 195
  countries from 1990-2016. Found that the level of alcohol consumption that minimizes
  health harm is zero drinks per week, contradicting earlier claims of protective
  effects from moderate drinking. Alcohol was the leading risk factor for death among
  15-49 year olds globally.
