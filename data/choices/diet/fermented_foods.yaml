  description: "Recommended: daily consumption. Yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut,
    miso provide live microbes and bioactive\ncompounds. Associated with improved
    gut microbiome diversity and metabolic\nhealth. Limited direct mortality studies.
    Fermented dairy shows strongest\nsafety profile. May reduce CVD risk, improve
    metabolic markers. Evidence\nquality low-moderate; research field evolving."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Limited direct mortality meta-analyses. Fermented dairy associated with
    beneficial health outcomes in observational studies. Gut microbiome
    modulation linked to reduced CVD risk and improved metabolic health.
    Meta-analysis shows fermented dairy safest due to beneficial bacteria
    and low pathogen content.

    Extrapolated estimate with high uncertainty.
  mean: 0.95
  std: 0.08
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Gut microbiome health linked to aging. Fermented foods may improve
    microbial diversity and resilience. No epigenetic clock studies.
    Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Gut-brain axis research suggests fermented foods may improve mood via
    microbiome modulation. Limited direct RCT evidence. Small positive
    effect plausible.

  std: 0.3
summary: "Yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso provide live microbes and bioactive\n\
  compounds. Associated with improved gut microbiome diversity and metabolic\nhealth."
