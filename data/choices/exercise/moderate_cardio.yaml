domain: exercise
name: Moderate Cardio (150-300 min/week)
summary: |
  WHO-recommended baseline: 150-300min/week moderate or 75-150min vigorous.
  Meta-analyses: 26-31% lower all-cause mortality, 28-38% lower CVD mortality
  at 300-600min/week. Cardiac rehab meta-analysis: 26% lower CV mortality, 47%
  lower reinfarction. Greatest benefit moving from sedentary to some activity.
  No upper limit of harm observed. Evidence quality very high.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      AHA 30-year cohort (n=100K+): 300-600min/week moderate activity: 26-31%
      lower all-cause mortality, 28-38% lower CVD mortality.
      (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162).
      Cochrane CR meta-analysis: 26% lower CV mortality.
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527136/). Causal and
      associative evidence; very robust.
    mean: 0.70
    std: 0.04
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Improves cardiorespiratory fitness strongly linked to biological aging.
      Reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. Associated with slower
      cognitive decline. Strong biological plausibility.
    mean: 2.0
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Exercise consistently associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety/
      depression in meta-analyses. Improved sleep quality. May enhance social
      connections. Moderate-large positive effect.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.3
