  description: "Recommended: 3+ cups/day. Rich in catechins (EGCG) with antioxidant
    and anti-inflammatory effects. Meta-\nanalysis of 38 cohorts (n=2M): 10% lower
    all-cause mortality, 14% lower CVD\nmortality for highest intake. Japanese cohort:
    22-33% lower CVD mortality with\n2+ cups/day. Modest BP reduction (-2mmHg). Evidence
    quality moderate for CVD;\ncancer evidence mixed."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 38 cohorts (n=1,956,549): RR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95) for
    all-cause mortality, RR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.79-0.94) for CVD mortality at
    highest intake. (https://www.e-epih.org/journal/view.php?number=1522).
    Three meta-analyses support 18-33% CVD mortality reduction.
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8189915/). Associative evidence.
  mean: 0.88
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    EGCG has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. May protect cognitive
    function. Associated with healthy aging in observational studies. No
    epigenetic clock data. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.7
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Contains L-theanine which may reduce anxiety. Caffeine provides alertness.
    Combined effect may improve focus and calm. Limited mood RCT data. Small
    positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
summary: "Rich in catechins (EGCG) with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
  Meta-\nanalysis of 38 cohorts (n=2M): 10% lower all-cause mortality, 14% lower CVD\n\
  mortality for highest intake."
