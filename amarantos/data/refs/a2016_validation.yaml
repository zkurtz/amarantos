summary: 'Retrospective matched case-control study validating a Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) in hospitalized pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Compared 110 unplanned PICU transfers with 220 matched controls, finding PEWS demonstrated strong predictive accuracy (AUC 0.96) for identifying clinical deterioration up to 24 hours before PICU admission.'
