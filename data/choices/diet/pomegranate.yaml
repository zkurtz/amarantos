  description: "Recommended: 240mL juice/day. Polyphenol-rich fruit with strong antioxidant
    capacity. Meta-analyses of RCTs\nshow significant BP reduction: -5 to -8mmHg SBP,
    -2 to -3mmHg DBP. Benefits\ngreater in hypertensives. No mortality RCTs. Anti-inflammatory
    and anti-\natherogenic properties. Sugar content of juice a consideration. Evidence\n\
    quality moderate for BP."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. 2017 meta-analysis of 8 RCTs: pomegranate juice
    reduced SBP by -4.96mmHg and DBP by -2.01mmHg.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27888156/). 2024 meta-analysis of 22
    RCTs: SBP -7.87mmHg, DBP -3.23mmHg.
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38410857/). Theoretical CVD benefit
    via BP reduction; extrapolated estimate.
  mean: 0.94
  std: 0.06
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    High antioxidant capacity. May improve vascular function. Animal studies
    suggest anti-aging effects. Urolithin A (pomegranate metabolite) shows
    promise for mitophagy. No human epigenetic clock data. Speculative.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    May improve exercise performance via nitrate content. Limited mood RCT
    data. Potential sugar content may affect those with metabolic issues.
    Small effect uncertain.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.3
summary: "Polyphenol-rich fruit with strong antioxidant capacity. Meta-analyses of
  RCTs\nshow significant BP reduction: -5 to -8mmHg SBP, -2 to -3mmHg DBP."
