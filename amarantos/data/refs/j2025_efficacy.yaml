summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs involving 513 adults examining NMN supplementation effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. While NMN successfully elevated blood NAD levels, no significant improvements were found in fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL. Authors caution about potential exaggeration of NMN benefits in the field.'
