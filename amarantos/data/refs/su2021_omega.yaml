summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials with
  149,051 participants examining omega-3 fatty acid effects on cardiovascular outcomes.
  Found significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.93), non-fatal MI
  (RR 0.87), CHD events (RR 0.91), and MACE (RR 0.95). EPA monotherapy showed greater
  benefits than EPA+DHA combination. Safety concern: increased atrial fibrillation
  risk (RR 1.26).'
