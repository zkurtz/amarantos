summary: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 20 prospective studies
  examining nut consumption and health outcomes. Found that higher nut intake is associated
  with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality, with
  benefits seen at approximately 28g (one serving) per day.
