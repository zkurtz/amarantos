domain: diet
name: Coffee (moderate, 3-4 cups/day)
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 40 prospective cohort studies (Poole et al. 2017).
      3-4 cups/day vs non-drinkers: HR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.88) for all-cause mortality.
      n=3.8 million participants across studies.
      Associative evidence; healthy user bias and residual confounding possible.
      Morning coffee timing may be more protective than all-day consumption (Eur Heart J 2024).
    mean: 0.83
    std: 0.023
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      No direct epigenetic clock studies for coffee consumption found.
      Extrapolated from mortality reduction: ~17% lower mortality roughly corresponds
      to 1-2 years of delayed aging using Gompertz mortality curve assumptions.
      Speculative estimate with high uncertainty.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 1.0
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies (Wang et al. 2016, n=346,913).
      High vs low consumption: RR 0.76 for depression.
      Dose-response: 8% lower depression risk per cup/day up to ~4 cups.
      Associative evidence. Acute mood effects from caffeine well-established.
      Effect may be partially confounded by social context of coffee consumption.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.2
