summary: "Effectively lowers homocysteine by ~12% but RCTs show NO reduction in CVD\n\
  events. Doses ≥4g/day increase LDL cholesterol, potentially offsetting any\nbenefit."

  description: "Recommended: 2-6g/day. Effectively lowers homocysteine by ~12% but
    RCTs show NO reduction in CVD\nevents. Doses ≥4g/day increase LDL cholesterol,
    potentially offsetting any\nbenefit. Lower doses (<4g/day) may lower homocysteine
    without adverse lipid\neffects. Overall, no proven cardiovascular or mortality
    benefit despite\nhomocysteine lowering."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.08
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis shows 4-6g/day lowers homocysteine by
    1.23μmol/L (~12%). Olthof 2005
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15916468/). However, homocysteine-
    lowering interventions (B vitamins) failed to reduce CVD events in trials.
    Higher doses raise LDL. Schwab 2021
    (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33764214/). Centered at null.
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.5
  evidence: |
    Methyl donor involved in cellular metabolism. No aging studies in humans.
    Theoretical benefit via homocysteine pathway unproven. Speculative.
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.3
  evidence: |
    No mood or wellbeing RCTs. Sometimes taken with NMN/NR for methylation
    support. No direct evidence for subjective benefit.
