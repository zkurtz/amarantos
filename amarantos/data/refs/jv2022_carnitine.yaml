summary: 'Mendelian randomization study examining genetically predicted L-carnitine levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Found higher L-carnitine associated with increased coronary artery disease (OR 1.07) and heart failure (OR 1.05) risk, particularly in men. Also associated with adverse lipid profile (higher triglycerides, lower HDL). Results do not support beneficial cardiovascular effects of L-carnitine.'
