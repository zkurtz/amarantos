  description: "Recommended: 20-30g/day, >70% cacao. High-cacao chocolate provides
    flavanols with cardiovascular benefits. Meta-\nanalysis of 21 cohorts (n=908,390):
    13% lower CVD mortality, 16% lower heart\ndisease mortality at highest intake.
    Optimal at <100g/week; higher intake may\nnegate benefits due to sugar. Mendelian
    randomization supports hypertension\nreduction. Evidence quality moderate."

- outcome: Relative mortality risk

    Zhao 2022 updated meta-analysis of 21 cohorts (n=908,390): 13% lower CVD
    mortality, 16% lower heart disease mortality, 12% lower cancer mortality
    for highest vs lowest consumption. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35460393/).
    Post-MI cohort: 66% reduction in cardiac mortality for 2x/week consumption.
    Associative evidence; dose-response non-linear.
  mean: 0.90
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Flavanols improve vascular function and may protect cognitive function.
    No epigenetic clock studies. Extrapolated from CVD risk reduction and
    cognitive benefits. Speculative.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.7
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Chocolate consumption associated with improved mood in observational
    studies. Contains theobromine and phenylethylamine. May enhance pleasure
    via palatability. Small positive effect plausible.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3

  analysis of 21 cohorts (n=908,390): 13% lower CVD mortality, 16% lower heart\ndisease
  mortality at highest intake."
