  notes: Comprehensive review of 363 articles from 2008-2018; proposes that disorders
    emerge when symptom networks become highly interconnected, creating stable states
    of elevated symptom activation; calls for identifying robust empirical phenomena
    and developing formal theories

summary: Comprehensive systematic literature review of 363 articles (2008-2018) on
  the network approach to psychopathology. This framework conceptualizes mental disorders
  as causal systems of mutually reinforcing symptoms rather than discrete entities.
  Disorders emerge when symptom networks become highly interconnected, creating stable
  states of symptom activation. Reviews applications in PTSD, depression, and anxiety
  research. Calls for bridging temporal scales and clarifying within-person vs between-person
  network structures.
