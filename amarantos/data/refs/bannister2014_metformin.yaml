- summary: Metformin-treated diabetics had longer survival than matched non-diabetic
    controls
  choice: metformin

  effects:
  - outcome: all-cause mortality

summary: Retrospective observational study using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink
  comparing 78,241 metformin-treated and 12,222 sulphonylurea-treated type 2 diabetics
  with 90,463 matched non-diabetic controls. Remarkably, metformin-treated diabetics
  had longer survival than non-diabetics (15% longer), while sulphonylurea users had
  38% shorter survival than metformin users. Supports metformin as first-line therapy
  and raises questions about potential longevity benefits beyond glycemic control.
