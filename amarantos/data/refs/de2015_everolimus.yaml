summary: 'Phase 1/2 trial of everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) plus gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) in 37 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. No dose-limiting toxicities in phase 1. However, 67% of phase 2 patients discontinued before week 12 due to disease progression or toxicity. mTOR inhibition paradoxically activated androgen receptor signaling, causing PSA rises in most patients. 35% showed paradoxical PSA elevation during treatment that declined upon stopping.'
