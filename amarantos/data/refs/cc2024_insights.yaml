- summary: Taurine supplementation significantly reduced systolic blood pressure
  choice: taurine

  effects:
  - outcome: systolic blood pressure reduction (mm Hg)
    mean: -4.0
    std: 1.0
  population: adults including healthy individuals and those with heart failure, hypertension,
    and diabetes

summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 RCTs (n=808) examining taurine
  supplementation effects on cardiovascular parameters. Taurine (0.5-6g daily for
  5-90 days) significantly improved multiple cardiovascular measures: heart rate (-3.6
  bpm), systolic BP (-4.0 mm Hg), diastolic BP (-1.4 mm Hg), LVEF (~5% increase),
  and NYHA functional classification. Benefits most pronounced in heart failure patients
  with no significant adverse effects.'
