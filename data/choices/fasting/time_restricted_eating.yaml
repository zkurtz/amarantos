domain: fasting
name: Time-Restricted Eating (8-10 hour eating window)
summary: |
  Limiting food intake to 8-10 hour daily window, typically aligning with
  circadian rhythms. Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs: modest weight loss (1-3 kg),
  improved insulin sensitivity. No mortality RCTs. Benefits may overlap with
  caloric restriction. Earlier eating window (eTRE) shows better metabolic
  outcomes. Evidence quality moderate; mostly short-term studies.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs: improves insulin sensitivity,
      reduces BP, promotes weight loss. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33302500/).
      NHANES observational data: eating window <8h associated with higher CVD
      mortality (contradictory; confounding likely). Effect on mortality unclear.
    mean: 0.95
    std: 0.10
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Activates autophagy and cellular repair pathways during fasting periods.
      Animal studies show lifespan extension. Human aging data limited.
      Early TRE may improve circadian alignment. Mechanistically plausible.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      May simplify eating decisions and improve meal satisfaction. Some
      report improved energy and mental clarity. Others find restriction
      challenging. Variable individual response. Small effect with
      uncertainty in direction.
    mean: 0.1
    std: 0.3
