summary: Prospective cohort analysis of 116,221 US adults from the Nurses Health Study
  and Health Professionals Follow-up Study with 30 years of follow-up. Found that
  meeting physical activity guidelines through either vigorous (75-149 min/wk) or
  moderate (150-299 min/wk) activity was associated with 19-25% lower all-cause mortality
  and even greater reductions in cardiovascular mortality.
