domain: diet
name: Glycine (3-5g/day)
summary: |
  Simplest amino acid, involved in collagen synthesis and glutathione production.
  Extended lifespan in mice. Lower levels associated with diabetes, CVD in
  observational studies. Mendelian randomization shows modest evidence for reduced
  BP and T2DM risk, but NOT CAD. GlyNAC combination shows promise in elderly.
  No mortality RCTs. Evidence mixed.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Mendelian randomization (n=230,947): genetically
      elevated glycine associated with reduced SBP and T2DM risk, but NOT
      with CAD. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08936-1). Mouse
      feeding studies showed no effect on atherosclerosis. Observational
      associations may not be causal. Centered at null with uncertainty.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Extended lifespan in mice. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6516426/).
      Supports glutathione synthesis. GlyNAC combination improved oxidative
      stress and metabolic markers in elderly RCTs.
      (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2022.852569/full).
      Moderate confidence for functional benefits.
    mean: 0.5
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      May improve sleep quality at higher doses. Supports collagen for
      joint health. GlyNAC improved cognitive endpoints in elderly. Small
      positive effect plausible.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
