domain: thermal
name: Red Light Therapy (600-1000nm, daily 10-20min)
summary: |
  Photobiomodulation using red/near-infrared light (600-1000nm). Umbrella review
  of RCTs: 17% moderate, 57% low, 26% very low certainty evidence. Best evidence
  for skin rejuvenation (collagen), wound healing, and chronic pain (NNT=4).
  May improve muscle endurance. No mortality or longevity data. Small studies,
  optimal protocols unclear. Evidence quality low-moderate.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality studies. Umbrella review of 35 meta-analyses: mostly low
      certainty evidence. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12326686/).
      May improve metabolic markers in some populations. Purely speculative
      for mortality.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.10
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      May improve skin quality (collagen synthesis). Potentially improves
      mitochondrial function via cytochrome c oxidase. RCT showed improved
      sleep in mild insomnia. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9855677/).
      Limited human aging data. Speculative.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.7
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      Meta-analysis: 2.8-point VAS pain reduction for chronic pain (NNT=4).
      May improve skin appearance and self-perception. Limited mood data.
      Small positive effect for pain conditions.
    mean: 0.2
    std: 0.3
