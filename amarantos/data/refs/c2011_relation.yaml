summary: "Prospective cohort study from the Framingham Offspring Cohort examining 1,391 dementia-free participants (mean age 60.9 years). Found higher concurrent dietary choline intake associated with better verbal and visual memory performance. Higher remote choline intake (measured 7 years prior) was associated with reduced white-matter hyperintensity volume on brain MRI. Verbal learning and executive function showed no significant associations with choline intake."
