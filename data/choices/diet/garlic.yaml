domain: diet
name: Garlic (1+ cloves/day or aged extract)
summary: |
  Allium vegetable with cardiovascular benefits. Meta-analyses show significant
  BP reduction: -8.3mmHg SBP, -5.5mmHg DBP in hypertensives, comparable to
  medications. Estimated 16-40% CVD risk reduction from BP effects. Aged garlic
  extract well-studied. Benefits strongest in hypertensives. Evidence quality
  moderate for BP; no direct mortality RCTs.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis of 12 trials (n=553): garlic reduces
      SBP by 8.3mmHg and DBP by 5.5mmHg in hypertensives.
      (https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(23)00519-9/fulltext).
      Estimated 16-40% CVD risk reduction from BP reduction alone.
      (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8031974/). Causal evidence
      for BP; mortality extrapolated.
    mean: 0.92
    std: 0.06
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Contains sulfur compounds with antioxidant properties. May reduce
      oxidative stress and improve vascular function. No epigenetic clock
      studies. Speculative.
    mean: 0.3
    std: 0.6
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No direct mood RCTs. May cause GI discomfort and bad breath in some.
      Immune support claims not well substantiated for wellbeing. Uncertain.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.3
