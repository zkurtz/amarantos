  description: "Recommended: 1000-4000 IU/day to sufficiency. Essential hormone-like
    vitamin; deficiency common. Meta-analysis of RCTs:\ndaily supplementation reduces
    cancer mortality by 12% (not incidence). All-cause\nmortality reduced 6% with
    >5 years follow-up. No effect on CVD mortality.\nDaily dosing more effective than
    intermittent bolus. Target serum 30-50ng/mL.\nEvidence quality moderate for cancer
    mortality; high for bone health."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of RCTs: cancer mortality RR 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79-0.96) with
    daily dosing. (https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/s0923-7534(19)31159-7/fulltext).
    All-cause mortality RR 0.94 with >3 years follow-up.
    (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/413032).
    CVD mortality NS. Benefit requires daily dosing, sufficient duration.
  mean: 0.92
  std: 0.04
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Vitamin D receptors throughout body. Deficiency associated with frailty
    and cognitive decline. May support muscle function. No epigenetic clock
    studies specific to supplementation. Moderate confidence.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Deficiency associated with depression. Meta-analyses show modest benefits
    for mood in deficient individuals. No clear benefit in replete individuals.
  mean: 0.2
  std: 0.3
