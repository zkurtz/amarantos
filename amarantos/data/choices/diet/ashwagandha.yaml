  description: "Recommended: 300-600mg/day. Adaptogenic herb with significant anxiolytic
    effects. Meta-analyses show\nlarge reductions in stress/anxiety scales (SMD ~1.5)
    and cortisol levels.\nNo mortality data. Generally safe short-term; long-term
    safety less studied.\nEvidence quality is low-moderate due to small trials and
    heterogeneity."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality studies. Reduces cortisol and stress markers which are
    associated with chronic disease, but causal link to mortality unproven.
    Centered at null with small uncertainty band reflecting theoretical
    benefit via stress reduction.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.1
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    No epigenetic clock studies. Reduces cortisol and oxidative stress markers.
    Some animal studies suggest lifespan effects. Human aging data absent.
    Speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 0.8
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Meta-analysis of 15 RCTs, n=873. Significant reductions in anxiety
    (SMD -1.55) and stress (SMD -1.75). Also reduces cortisol levels.
    Causal evidence from RCTs but low certainty due to heterogeneity.
