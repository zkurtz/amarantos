  description: "Recommended: 300-600mg/day. Antioxidant with modest benefits for glycemic
    control and diabetic neuropathy.\nNo mortality data from large trials. Small weight
    loss effect (~1.3kg). May\nreduce inflammatory markers. Generally well-tolerated.
    Evidence quality is low\nto moderate."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No large-scale mortality trials. One small COVID-19 RCT (n=17) showed
    non-significant trend toward lower 30-day mortality (37.5% vs 77.8%, p=0.09).
    Cannot draw conclusions from this. Zhong 2021
    (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.566609/full).
    Centered at null with large uncertainty.
  mean: 1.0
  std: 0.15
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Antioxidant properties theoretically relevant to aging. Reduces some
    inflammatory markers. No epigenetic clock or biological age studies.
    Animal studies show lifespan extension but human translation uncertain.
    Highly speculative.
  mean: 0.0
  std: 1.0
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Improves diabetic neuropathy symptoms (pain, burning). Meta-analysis of
    9 RCTs shows benefit for neuropathy. Soliman 2024
    (https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/ent/Article/1004125). Indirect
    wellbeing benefit through symptom relief in diabetics only.
  mean: 0.1
  std: 0.2
summary: Antioxidant with modest benefits for glycemic control and diabetic
  neuropathy. No mortality data from large trials.
