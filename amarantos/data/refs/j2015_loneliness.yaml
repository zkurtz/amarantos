summary: Meta-analysis examining loneliness and social isolation as mortality risk
  factors using studies from 1980-2014. Found social isolation (OR 1.29), loneliness
  (OR 1.26), and living alone (OR 1.32) all significantly increased mortality risk.
  Effects were more pronounced in adults under 65 and comparable to well-established
  mortality risk factors.
