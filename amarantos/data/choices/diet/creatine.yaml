  description: "Recommended: 3-5g/day. Well-studied ergogenic aid. Meta-analyses show
    cognitive benefits: improved\nmemory (SMD 0.31) and attention, especially in older
    adults. Enhances muscle\nstrength and lean mass with exercise. No mortality RCTs.
    Safe for long-term\nuse (up to 2 years studied). May benefit brain health via
    enhanced cellular\nenergy."
effects:
- outcome: Relative mortality risk
  evidence: |
    No mortality RCTs. Improves muscle strength and functional capacity in
    older adults, which is associated with lower mortality risk. May preserve
    brain function. Indirect evidence only. Extrapolated estimate with high
    uncertainty.
  mean: 0.97
  std: 0.10
- outcome: Years of delayed aging
  evidence: |
    Supports muscle mass preservation (sarcopenia prevention). 2024 meta-analysis
    shows cognitive benefits including memory (SMD 0.31).
    (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11275561/). May protect brain
    during metabolic stress. No epigenetic clock data. Moderate confidence
    for functional aging.
  mean: 0.5
  std: 0.6
- outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
  evidence: |
    Enhanced exercise capacity and strength gains may improve physical
    self-efficacy. Cognitive benefits may improve mental clarity. Some
    evidence for mood benefits. Small positive effect likely.
  mean: 0.3
  std: 0.3
summary: "Well-studied ergogenic aid. Meta-analyses show cognitive benefits: improved\n\
  memory (SMD 0.31) and attention, especially in older adults."
