summary: Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs involving 127,477 participants with mean 5-year
  follow-up examining marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes.
  Found significant reductions in myocardial infarction (RR 0.92), CHD death (RR 0.92),
  and CVD death (RR 0.93). Risk reductions showed linear dose-response relationships
  with omega-3 dose.
