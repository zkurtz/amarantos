summary: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 RCTs examining melatonin supplementation and sleep quality measured by PSQI. Found significant improvement in sleep quality (WMD -1.24, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.71). Effects were strongest in adults with respiratory diseases (WMD -2.20) and metabolic disorders (WMD -2.74), but not significant in those with mental or neurodegenerative conditions.'
