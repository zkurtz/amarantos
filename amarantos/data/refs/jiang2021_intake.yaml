summary: "Meta-analysis of 25 prospective cohort studies including 2,027,512 participants and 103,734 CVD deaths. Found that both fish consumption (RR=0.91) and marine n-3 PUFA intake (RR=0.87) were inversely associated with cardiovascular disease mortality risk, with dose-response relationships showing 4% risk reduction per 20g fish or 80mg n-3 PUFA daily increase."
