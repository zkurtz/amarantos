domain: diet
name: Resveratrol (150-500mg/day)
summary: |
  Polyphenol found in red grapes with extensive preclinical longevity data.
  Human RCTs show mixed results: some BP reduction, inconsistent effects on
  lipids and inflammation. High doses (≥1000mg/day) may increase LDL. Conflicting
  findings possibly due to gut microbiome variation. No mortality RCTs.
  Translation from animal to human disappointing. Evidence quality low.
effects:
  - outcome: Relative mortality risk
    evidence: |
      No mortality RCTs. Meta-analysis shows some BP reduction and anti-
      inflammatory effects in CVD patients.
      (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35905799/). High doses associated with
      increased LDL/TC. Inconsistent effects across trials.
      (https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/2/747). Clinical evidence does not
      support clear benefit. Centered at null.
    mean: 1.0
    std: 0.08
  - outcome: Years of delayed aging
    evidence: |
      Strong preclinical evidence for lifespan extension via SIRT1 activation.
      Human translation limited. No epigenetic clock studies show benefit.
      Speculative for human aging.
    mean: 0.0
    std: 0.8
  - outcome: Subjective wellbeing - number of just-noticeable differences
    evidence: |
      No direct mood RCTs. May improve cognitive function in some populations.
      Limited evidence. Uncertain effect.
